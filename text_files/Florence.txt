AUTHOR'S    PREFACE  TO   THE
ENGLISH  VERSION.


\EFORE  deciding  to  issue  this  translation
I  had  first  to  reflect  whether  my  Floren-
tine studies  could  be  of  any  use  to  the
English  public.  Since  Roscoes  day^
English  literature  has  been  enriched  by
works  of  much  importance  on  different
'phases  of  the  political^  literary^  and  artistic  history  of
Florence.  Both  Napier  and  Trollope  have  bequeathed
very  complete  narratives  of  Florentine  events,  and  trans-
lations of  notable  foreign  works  have  also  been  produced.
But  nearly  all  these  works  appeared  before  any  scientific
research  as  to  the  origin  of  the  City  and  Commonwealth
had  begun^  or^  at  leasts  before  it  had  reached  the  results
I  have  briefly  expounded^  and  which  deserve  notice^  not
only  on  the  score  of  intrinsic  worthy  but  also  because  they
throw  new  light  on  the  subsequent  history  of  Florence.

To  attempt  any  new  delineation  of  the  special  vicissi-
tudes of  the  Florentine  Republic^  already  so  exhaustively
and  lucidly  treated  by  other  historians^  would  have  been

outside  my  purpose.  As  stated  in  the  preface  to  the  Italian
edition^  my  sole  aim  was  to  investigate  in  what  manner  the
Republic  was  formed^  the  nature  of  its  constitution^  the
why  and  wherefore  of  its  continual  transmutations,  the
first  causes  and  genuine  motives  of  the  factions  by  which
the  city  was  torn^  and  likewise  to  ascertain  how  it  came
about  that — despite  all  this  turbulence  and  strife — com-
merce and  industry,  the  fine  arts  and  letters  should  have
been  able  to  achieve  such  marvellous  results.  Now,  so  far
as  I  know,  English  literature  contains  nothing  on  this
particular  theme,  although  one  that  can  scarcely  fail  to  be
of  some  use  and  interest  even  to  readers  familiar  with
greater  works  and  more  extended  and  detailed  accounts  of
Florentine  history.

These  researches  are  not  pursued  beyond  the  times  of  Dante
and  Henry  VII.,  inasmuch  as  that  term  actually  marks
the  close  of  the  period  during  which  the  Republic  took  shape
and  built  up  its  constitution.  This  was  followed  by  a  new
phase  of  equally  high  importance  but  very  different  cha-
racter, during  which  the  Republic  entered,  instead,  on  a
course  of  decomposition.  In  fact,  we  have  only  to  draw  a
comparison  between  the  "  Divine  Comedy  "  and  the  "  De-
cameron,'* to  instantly  perceive  how  deep  was  the  change  a
few  years  had  wrought  in  the  spirit  of  Florence  and  of  all
Italy.  These  two  works  were  almost  contemporaneous,  yet
when  reading  them  they  seem  to  us  the  product  of  two  entirely
different  ages.  Whether  in  politics,  religion,  morals,  or
letters,  the  character  of  these  two  periods  is  seen  to  be  essen-
tially diverse.  The  Middle  Ages,  with  all  their  rough
primitive  originality,  have  come  to  an  end ;  classic  learning
and  the  Renaissance  have  begun.      Touching  this  second

■period^  there  is  no  scarcity  of  information^  documents^  or
chroniclers^  as  in  the  case  of  the  first.  The  historian  is
confronted  by  totally  novel  'problems  to  which  numerous
modern  writers  have  given  their  attention^  and  which  have
also  been  investigated  in  previous  works  of  my  own.

Even  this  second  period  would  certainly  afford  matter
for  another  work  on  the  gradual  course  of  political  and
moral  dissolution^  during  which  art  and  literature  blossomed
to  new  splendour.  Such  investigations^  however,  would
transport  me  beyond  the  limits  I  have  set  to  this  book.
Under  what  conditions  and  amid  what  difficulties  these
researches  were  begun  and  carried  forward  has  been
already  plainly  told  in  my  preface  to  the  Italian  edition.
It  only  remains  for  me  to  crave  the  indulgence  of  English
readers.

PJS^UALE  VILLARI,


AUTHOR'S  PREFACE.


WORD  of  explanation  is  due  to  my
readers  touching  the  genesis  of  the
present  work.

In  1866  I  began  a  course  of  lectures
at  our  Istituto  Superiore  on  the
History  of  Florence,  chiefly  for  the
purpose  of  examining  the  political  constitution  of  the
Republic,  and  investigating  the  various  transformations
it  had  undergone  during  the  long  series  of  internal
revolutions  by  which  the  city  was  harassed.  In  this
way  I  hoped  to  ascertain  the  veritable  causes  of  those
revolutions,  to  discover  some  leading  thread  through  the
mazes  of  Florentine  history,  which  even  when  treated
by  great  writers  has  often  been  found  exceedingly  in-
volved and  obscure,  ariu  likewise  to  determine  the  most
logical  mode  of  arranging  it  in  periods.  Even  a  partial
solution  of  these  problems  would  have  been  of  some  use.
I  continued  the  lectures  for  a  considerable  time,  but  sus-
pended them  on  reaching  the  period  of  Giano  della  Bella's
"  Decrees  of  Justice  "  {Ordinamenti  di  Giustizia)^  1293.
Some  of  these  discourses  were  published  in  the  Milan
PolitecnicOy  others  in  the  Nuova  Antologia  at  Florence.
It  was  then  my  intention  to  collect  them  in  a  volume ;


X  A  UTHORS  PRE  FA  CE.

but  after  some  hesitation  I  renounced  the  idea.  It  seemed
indispensable  to  at  least  add  some  outline  of  the  course
of  events  subsequent  to  the  fall  of  Giano  della  Bella  and
the  exile  of  Dante,  in  order  to  conclude  the  first  and  most
important  period  of  the  political  history  of  Florence.
Besides,  I  saw  that  the  necessity  of  continuing  these
lectures  on  fixed  days  had  not  always  allowed  sufficient
time  for  overcoming  obstacles  encountered  by  the  way.
Accordingly,  more  than  a  superficial  revisal  was  required  ;
gaps  had  to  be  filled  in,  certain  pages  re-written.  Hence
fresh  researches  were  demanded,  for  which  other  labours
granted  no  leisure  at  the  moment.

Meanwhile  new  documents,  new  dissertations,  and
monographs  on  Florentine  history  were  continually
appearing,  besides  notable  works  on  a  larger  scale  such
as  those  of  Capponi,  Del  Lungo,  Hartwig,  Perrens,  &c.
All  this  increased  the  difficulty  of  revising  and  correcting
lectures,  now  lapsing  inevitably  more  and  more  out  of
date.  On  the  other  hand  I  sometimes  found  previous
deductions  confirmed  by  recently  discovered  documents,
and  that  certain  general  ideas  I  had  enounced  were
accepted  and  followed  by  writers  of  note.  This  naturally
inclined  me  to  be  less  severe  in  judging  my  work,  and
more  disposed  to  listen  to  the  tried  friends  who  were
urging  its  republication.

Being  thus  encouraged  to  resume  my  forsaken  studies,
I  lectured  in  1888  on  the  times  of  Henry  VII.  of
Germany  and  the  exile  of  Dante.  Later  on,  in  1890,
recognising  that  my  previous  work  on  the  origins  of  the
city  and  its  commonwealth  had  become  altogether  in-
adequate since  the  appearance  of  so  much  new  material,
I  returned  to  the  subject  in  a  fresh  course  of  lectures,
which  likewise  saw  the  light  in  the  Nuova  Antologia.
Then,  I  finally  began  to  put  the  scattered  papers  together
to  revise  and  correct  them.


AUTHORS  PREFACE.  xi

Hence  it  will  be  plainly  seen  that  this  book  is  composed
of  various  separate  parts  which,  although  informed,  one
and  all,  by  the  same  leading  idea  and  treating  of  the
same  argument,  were  produced  at  distant  intervals  during
a  quarter  of  a  century,  in  which  the  study  of  Florentine
history  had  made  rapid  advance  through  the  labours  of
numerous  and  competent  writers.  Therefore,  in  spite  of
devoting  my  best  efforts  to  pruning,  revising,  and  arrang-
ing my  lectures,  they  are  still  old  essays  more  or  less
disjointed,  and  containing  many  unavoidable  repetitions.
Greater  organic  unity  could  only  have  been  attained  by
re-writing  the  whole  and  composing  a  new  book  ;  whereas
my  intention  was  merely  to  republish  a  series  of  scattered
compositions,  under  the  fitting  title  of  "  Researches."

What  finally  decided  me  to  reprint  them  was,  that,
as  I  venture  to  think,  their  dominant  and  fundamental
notes  still  ring  true,  even  after  the  numerous  works
produced  by  other  hands.  Indeed,  unless  I  be  mistaken,
those  works  frequently  support  my  observations,  and
confirm  the  ideas  expressed  throughout  on  the  general
character  and  progressive  development  of  Florentine
history.  Whether  I  be  right  or  wrong  in  this  belief  the
reader  must  decide.  At  any  rate  I  venture  to  hope
that,  in  judging  this  book,  he  will  kindly  make  allowance
for  the  time  and  manner  in  which  it  came  into  existence.

INTRODUCTION.^


^^^^^^^^


I.


^)HE  history  of  Italian  freedom,  from
the  Middle  Ages  to  the  new  series
of  foreign  invasions,  dating  from
the  descent  of  Charles  VIII.  in  1494,
mainly  consists  of  the  history  of  our
communes.  But  this  history  is  as  yet
unwritten,  and,  worse  still,  can  never  be  written  until  the
material  required  for  the  task  shall  have  been  brought  to
light,  sifted,  and  illustrated.  What  were  the  most  ancient
political  statutes,  what  those  of  the  guilds  of  art  and
commerce,  what  the  penal  and  civil  laws,  the  individual
conditions,  revenue,  expenditure,  trade,  and  industry  of
those  republics  ?  To  all  these  questions  we  can  give  but
imperfect  replies  at  the  best,  and  some  are  left  altogether
unsolved.  Yet  until  all  are  decided  the  civil  history  of
our  communes  remains  involved  in  obscurity.

Through  Machiavelli  and  Giannone  Italy  gave  the
world  the  first  essays  in  constitutional  history,  and  by
Muratori's  gigantic  labours  inaugurated  the  great  school
of  learning  that  is  the  only  settled  basis  of  modern  and,
more  especially,  of  constitutional  history.  But  we  soon
allowed  the  sceptre  we  had  won  to  be  snatched  from  our

2  INTRODUCTION.

grasp.  It  is  true  that  we  have  never  experienced  any
dearth  of  great  scholars  or  historians,  but  the  complete
national  history  of  a  people  is  a  task  exceeding  the  powers
of  one  or  of  several  individuals.  Such  history  must  be
produced,  as  it  were,  by  the  nation  itself.  Only  the  com-
bined efforts  of  many  scholars  and  of  many  generations
can  succeed  in  co-ordinating  and  investigating  the  vast
mass  of  material  that  has  to  be  ransacked  in  order  to  trace
through  the  vicissitudes  of  numerous  municipalities,  all
differing  from,  and  at  war  with  one  another,  the  history
of  the  Italian  people.  It  has  been  long  the  custom  with
us  for  every  one  to  work  independently  :  hence  we  lack
the  spirit  of  agreement  and  co-operation  required  to  enable
individual  efforts  to  carry  forward  the  work  of  the  whole
country  at  the  same  pace.  Certainly,  however,  I  must  not
forget  to  note  the  example  of  our  various  national  histo-
rical societies,  subsidised  by  the  Government,  and  composed
of  most  learned  and  deserving  men.  But  these  associa-
tions and  commissions  have  as  yet  no  general  nor  united
plan  of  work ;  and,  in  fact,  some  of  their  members  are
apt  to  devote  their  energies  to  labours  which,  however
important,  are  disconnected  from  the  main  object.  Thus
there  will  be  much  delay  before  our  learned  men  complete
the  investigation  of  any  one  period  of  our  history.  Yet
the  rules  which  should  be  followed  are  not  far  to  seek,
since  Italians  were  the  first  to  discover  them,  and  we  still
bear  them  in  mind.  Nor  has  the  issue  of  highly  important
collections  of  documents  been  relegated  exclusively  to  our
societies  and  commissions.  None  can  have  forgotten  the
untiring  labours  of  the  worthy  Vieusseux  and  his  friends
in  their  management  of  the  "  Archivio  Storico  Italiano  "  !
To  show  what  excellent  results  may  be  achieved  by  the
publication  of  a  single  series  of  State  papers,  it  is  sufficient
to  mention  the  Despatches  {Relazioni]  of  Venetian  Ambas-
sadors, given  to  the  world  by  Alberi,  and  whereby  not

only  Italian  but  European  history  has  been  so  greatly
profited.  What  progress  might  not  be  made  would  all
Italian  scholars  consent  to  devote  their  labours  to  a
common  end  !  We  have  seen  how  much  Professor  Pertz
was  enabled  to  achieve  at  Berlin,  with  a  subsidy  from  the
Confederation,  and  aided  by  all  the  scholars  of  Germany.
Truly,  his  "  Monumenta  "  form  an  enduring  memorial  of
the  national  history  of  the  Fatherland,  and  has  become
the  nucleus  of  a  new  school  of  scholars  and  historians.

Now  that  Italy  is  united,  and  her  many  states  fused
into  one,  she  should  know  the  history  of  her  communes,
and  trace  out  the  history  of  her  people.     It  should  also  be
kept  in  view  that  the  Commune  was  the  institution  by
whose  means  modern  society  was  evolved  from  the  Middle
Ages.     Rising  in  the  midst  of  a  throng  of  slaves,  vassals,
barons,  marquises,  dukes,  the  Commune  gave  birth  to  the
third  estate  and  the  people  which,  after  first  destroying
feudalism  in  Italy,  subsequently  by  the  French  Revolu-
tion, destroyed  it   throughout  Europe.     Even  Augustin
Thierry  notes  that  "  thus  was  formed  the  immense  congre-
gation of  free  men  who  in  1789  undertook  for  all  France
that    which    had    been    achieved    by  their  forefathers    in
mediaeval  municipalities."  ^     Accordingly,  since  Italy  was
the  centre  and  seat  of  municipal  liberty,  the  purpose  of  the
present  work  is  not  only  to  investigate  our  civil  history,
but  to  demonstrate  how  much  we  contributed  to  the  dis-
covery of  the  principles  of  modern  society  and  civilisation.
All  careful  students  of  the  history  of  Roman  law  in  the
Middle  Ages  will  have  occasion  to  remark  that  our  com-
mentators while  reviewing  ancient  jurisprudence,  uncon-
sciously modified  it  in  adapting   it   to  their  own  times.
Francesco  Forti  has  declared  that  no  student  of  our  statutes
can  fail  to  perceive  that  many  of  the  regulations  found  in
the  Napoleon  Code,  and  supposed  to  be  created  by  the

'  "  Lettres  sur  I'hist.  de  France."  close  of  Letter  xxv.


4  INTRODUCTION.

French  Revolution,  already  formed  part  of  the  old  Italian
law.  I  have  come  to  the  conclusion  that  in  every  branch
of  Italian  civil  life  our  history  will  be  able  to  prove  that
the  same  remark  holds  good,  inasmuch  as  our  civil  insti-
tutions contained  the  primary  germs  of  modern  freedom.
But  no  one  has  yet  dared  to  attempt  this  task,  and,  as  I
said  before,  no  single  strength  could  suffice  for  it.  We
have  now  to  deal  with  a  far  humbler  theme.  By  tracing
in  bold  outline  the  history  of  a  single  commune,  we  desire
to  show  what  fresh  researches  remain  to  be  made,  and  how
many  problems  to  be  solved.

The  vicissitudes  of  the  Florentine  Republic  can  only  be
paralleled  with  those  of  the  most  flourishing  periods  of
Athenian  freedom.  Throughout  modern  history  we  might
seek  in  vain  the  example  of  another  city  simultaneously  so
turbulent  and  prosperous,  where,  despite  so  much  internecine
carnage,  fine  arts,  letters,  commerce,  and  industry,  all
flourished  equally.  The  historian  almost  doubts  his  own
veracity  when  bound  to  recount  how  a  handful  of  men
settled  on  a  small  spot  of  earth,  extended  their  trade  to
the  East  and  the  West  ;  establishing  banks  throughout
Europe ;  and  accumulated  such  vast  wealth,  that  private
fortunes  sometimes  sufficed  to  support  tottering  thrones.
He  has  also  to  relate  how  these  rich  merchants  founded
modern  poetry  with  their  Dante,  painting  with  their
Giotto  ;  how  with  the  aid  of  their  Arnolfo  and  Brunel-
lesco,  and  of  their  Michelangelo,  who  was  poet,  painter,
sculptor,  and  architect  in  one,  they  raised  the  stupendous
buildings  which  the  world  will  lastingly  admire.  The
first  and  subtlest  of  European  diplomatists  were  Floren-
tines ;  political  science  and  civil  history  were  born  in
Florence  with  Machiavelli.  Towards  the  end  of  the
Middle  Ages  this  narrow  township  seems  a  small  point  of
fire  shedding  light  over  the  whole  world.

It  might  well  be  thought  that  all  difficulties  regarding


INTRODUCTION.  S

the  history  of  this  commune  must  have  been  already
overcome,  seeing  that  the  finest  Italian  writers,  the
greatest  modern  historians,  have  for  so  long  made  it  the
theme  of  extended  labours.  In  fact,  what  other  city  can
boast  annals  penned  by  such  men  as  Villani,  Compagni,
Machiavelli,  Guicciardini,  Nardi,  Varchi  ?  And,  in  addi-
tion to  histories  and  chronicles,  we  find  an  endless  string
of  Diaries,  Prioristi  (Notebooks),  Reminiscences,  before
coming  down  to  modern  writers.  Among  the  Florentines
it  was  a  very  common  practice  to  keep  a  daily  register  of
events,  and  in  this  wise  their  splendid  store  of  historic
literature  was  continually  enlarged.  But,  nevertheless,  no
history  bristles  with  so  many  difficulties  as  that  of  Florence,
nor  offers  so  many  apparently  insurmountable  contradic-
tions. Events  pass  before  our  eyes,  well  described,  vividly
coloured;  they  flit  past  in  a  rapid  and  uninterrupted
whirl,  never  resting,  subject  to  no  law,  and  seemingly
obedient  to  chance  alone.  Personal  hatred,  jealousy,  and
private  revenge  produce  political  revolutions,  drenching
the  city  with  the  blood  of  its  children.  These  revolutions
endure  for  months,  perhaps  even  for  years,  and  end  with
arbitrary  decrees,  which  are  violated  or  undone  the  moment
they  have  received  magisterial  sanction.  Thus  we  are
often  moved  to  inquire.  How  can  this  be  the  work  of  far-
seeing  diplomats,  of  great  politicians .?  Either  lofty
commendations  for  political  good  sense  and  acuteness
were  falsely  lavished  on  men  incapable  of  giving  their
country  sound  laws  and  stable  institutions,  and  who  in
the  gravest  affairs  of  State  were  solely  influenced  by  per-
sonal loves  and  hates  ;  or  else  for  centuries  past  we  have
accorded  unmerited  praise  to  the  historians  who  have
described  impossible  events  to  us  in  the  most  vivid
colours.  In  fact,  how  could  it  possibly  be  that  so  much
good  sense  should  breed  so  much  disorder.?  How,  too,
in  the  midst  of  this  disorder,  with  the  vessel  of  the  State

at  the  mercy  of  every  wind  that  blew,  could  art,  science,
and  literature  give  forth  so  glorious  a  harvest  ?

Undoubtedly  history,  as  we  interpret  it  to-day,  was
unknown  to  the  ancients.  We  seek  the  causes  of  events,
whereas  they  merely  described  them.  We  wish  to  know
the  laws,  manners,  ideas,  and  prejudices  of  mankind,
whereas  our  forefathers  were  exclusively  concerned  with
human  passions  and  actions.  In  the  fifteenth  century
political  science  was  chiefly  a  study  of  human  nature,
while  at  this  day  it  is  mainly  a  study  of  institutions.
Modern  history  aims  at  the  examination  of  mankind  and
society  in  every  form,  and  from  every  point  of  view.
That  is  why  we  have  had  to  so  often  re-fashion  the  work
that,  nevertheless,  had  been  splendidly  performed  by
writers  of  old.

Leaving  aside  all  compilers  of  those  fables  and  legends
on  the  origin  of  Florence  found  repeated  in  even  later
works,  Florentine  historians  may  be  divided  into  two
great  schools.  First  come  the  authors  of  Chronicles  or
Diaries,  who  flourished  chiefly  in  the  fourteenth  century,
although  they  continued  long  after  that  period.  These
writers  record  day  by  day  the  events  they  have  wit-
nessed and  in  which  they  have  often  taken  part  ;  stirred
by  the  very  passions  they  describe,  they  sometimes  rise
to  eloquence,  and  the  heat  of  their  own  words  leaves  them
no  time  to  dwell  on  abstract  ideas.  They  presuppose  in
their  readers  their  own  detailed  knowledge  of  the  political
institutions  among  which  their  lives  were  spent,  but  which
are  unknown  to  us,  and  the  object  of  our  keenest  desire.
Frequently,  however,  some  fourteenth-century  chronicler,
such  as  Giovanni  Villani,  with  his  incomparable  gift  of
observation,  supplies  such  minute  descriptions  of  events,
reports  so  many  details,  that,  almost  unawares,  we  find
ourselves  carried  back  to  his  day.  Sometimes,  when
descending  to  particulars,  he  apologises  for  detaining  the


INTRODUCTION,  7

reader  on  topics  of  small  moment,  little  foreseeing  what
value  we  later  generations  would  attach  to  all  those
details  of  the  trade,  instruction,  revenue,  and  expendi-
ture of  the  Republic,  or  how  we  should  long  for  more
facts  of  the  same  kind.  But  as  soon  as  these  writers
touch  upon  times  and  events  outside  their  own  experience,
they  have  either  to  copy  verbatim  from  other  chroniclers,
or  their  narratives  remain  cold,  colourless,  and  devoid  of
merit  or  authority.  We  pass  at  once  from  the  most
lively  and  graphic  descriptions  to  the  strangest  fables,  the
greatest  incoherence,  since  these  men  are  incapable  of
using  any  discernment  even  in  copying  literally  from
others.  Proofs  of  this  are  seen  in  their  puerile  accounts
of  the  foundation  of  Florence.  Historical  criticism  was
as  yet  unborn.

The  scholarship  of  the  fifteenth  century  gave  rise  to
the  study  and  imitation  of  Sallust  and  Livy  ;  and  Italian
writers  were  no  longer  content  to  register  facts  from  day
to  day,  unconnectedly  and  without  order.  Many  wrote
in  Latin,  others  in  Italian  ;  but  all  sought  to  compose
historical  narratives  in  a  more  artistic,  or  at  all  events,
more  artificial  way.  They  launched  into  exordiums
and  general  considerations  ;  gave  lengthy  descriptions,
eked  out  by  many  flights  of  fancy,  of  wars  they
had  never  witnessed,  and  of  which  they  knew  little
or  nothing  ;  they  attributed  imaginary  speeches  to  their
personages,  and  sometimes  fashioned  their  narratives
in  the  shape  of  dialogues,  to  increase  the  distance
between  themselves  and  their  fourteenth-century  pre-
decessors, i

It  was  a  period  of  rhetorical  essays  and  servile  imita-
tions of  the  classics,  during  which  Italian  history  and
literature  declined,  although  preparing  for  revival  in  the
coming  age.     In  fact,  we  find  the  art  of  history  notably

'  See,  for  example,  Goro  Dati's  "  Storia  di  Firenze. '

advanced  in  the  sixteenth  century.  Machiavelli,  who  may
be  styled  the  most  illustrious  founder  of  that  art,  begins
with  a  word  of  blame  to  preceding  historians  exactly
because  '*  they  had  said  little  or  nothing  of  civil  discords,
or  of  existing  internal  enmities  and  their  effects,  and
described  other  matters  with  a  brevity  that  could  be
neither  useful  nor  pleasing  to  the  reader."  Indirectly,
these  words  serve  as  a  faithful  portrait  of  the  book  that
has  proved  the  most  lasting  monument  to  his  own  fame.
He  inquires  into  the  causes  of  events,  the  origin  of  all
the  parties  and  revolutions  of  the  Republic ;  thus
creating  a  new  method  and  opening  a  new  road.  He
reduces  the  whole  history  of  the  Commonwealth  into  an
admirable  unity  ;  he  rejects  with  profound  contempt
the  fabulous  tales  bequeathed  by  the  chronicler  regarding
the  foundation  of  Florence,  and  throws  an  eagle  glance
on  party  manoeuvres  from  their  origin  down  to  his  own
day.  He  was  the  first  to  undertake  these  researches,  and,
notwithstanding  all  newer  investigations,  his  fundamental
idea  maintains  its  value.

But  Machiavelli  gave  little  heed  to  institutions,  scarcely
any  at  all  to  laws  and  customs.  Furthermore,  he  was  so
entirely  guided  by  his  instinct  of  divination  as  to  care
little  for  the  historic  exactitude  of  particular  facts.  To
ascertain  the  infinite  number  of  inaccuracies  and  blunders
contained  in  his  book,  and  which  would  be  unpardonable
in  a  modern  writer,  his  narrative  must  be  compared  with
the  contemporary  accounts  of  the  old  chroniclers,  some  of
which  were  known  to  him.  Not  only  are  there  frequent
errors  of  date,  but  also  of  the  names  and  number  of
magistrates  and  of  the  framework  of  institutions.  It
would  seem  that  while  divining  the  spirit  of  events,  he
simultaneously  remoulded  them  according  to  his  own
fancy.  Sometimes  we  find  him  appropriating  entire  pages
from  Cavalcanti's  history,  even  transcribing  the  fictitious


INTRODUCTION.  9

speeches  attributed  by  that  chronicler  to  historic  characters,
and  by  a  few  touches  of  his  own  pouring  new  life  into
the  dull  narrative  without  troubling  to  undertake  any
fresh  research.  Thus,  his  book,  although  a  valuable  guide,
is  also  an  unsafe  one.  He  cannot  always  abstain  from
transplanting  a  true  fact  to  the  place  best  suited  to  his
own  theories,  thus  filling  up  inconvenient  gaps  without
many  scruples  of  conscience.  His  aim,  so  he  tells  us,
was  to  investigate  the  causes  of  parties  and  revolutions.
What  is  now  designated  as  local  colour — /.(?.,  the  historic
colour  of  facts — is  entirely  absent  from  his  narrative,  and
particularly  from  that  of  the  earlier  days  of  the  Republic.
Men  adhere  to  different  factions,  sometimes  commit  evil,
sometimes  generous  deeds,  but  are  apparently  always  the
same  in  his  eyes.  To  what  extent  the  clear  appreciation
of  events  is  hampered  by  this  theory  may  easily  be
imagined.  Then,  too,  as  Machiavelli  draws  nearer  to  his
own  times,  he  sees  the  constitution  of  the  Republic
changing  and  decaying,  freedom  disappearing,  and  a
thousand  personal  passions  arising  to  hasten  the  over-
throw of  enfeebled  institutions.  A  knowledge  of  minute
particulars  would  be  doubly  desirable  at  this  period  to
make  us  understand  the  social  revolution  in  question  ;  but
Machiavelli,  though  always  a  fifteenth-century  Florentine,
never  lost  sight  of  the  example  of  Titus  Livy  and  other
Roman  writers,  and  consequently,  like  all  the  scholars  of
his  age,  was  inspired  with  a  lofty  contempt  for  any  small
details  apt  to  endanger  the  epic  unity  of  historic  narrative.
Then,  later  on,  in  approaching  the  distinct  domination  of
the  Medici,  under  whose  rule  he  was  living,  he  turns  aside
with  ill-concealed  disgust  from  the  internal  vicissitudes  of
the  Republic  and  gives  his  whole  attention  to  external
events.  He  then  discourses  of  warfare  and  of  the  Italian
policy  that  was  the  passion  of  his  life.  In  the  midst  of
court  intrigues  and  the  contested  predominance  of  this  or


10  INTRODUCTION.

that  party,  we  find  him  chiefly  concerned  in  ascertaining
how  a  new  prince  might  best  reunite  the  scattered
members  of  his  torn  and  oppressed  motherland  ;  and  note
that  this  noble  design  frequently  makes  him  forget  the
history  of  Florence.

In  reading  old  chronicles  of  contemporary  events,  we
see  before  our  eyes  the  living,  speaking  figures  of  Giano
della  Bella,  Farinata  degli  Uberti,  Corso  Donati,  and
Michele  di  Lando.  Their  feelings,  loves,  and  hates  are
known  and  almost  familiar  to  us ;  but  we  are  plunged  in
a  restless,  unrestrained  tumult  of  passions,  without  know-
ing whence  blows  the  blast  driving  men  and  things  onward
in  a  whirl  of  confusion,  without  one  moment's  truce.
No  sooner  do  we  pass  beyond  the  visual  horizon  of  the
writer,  than  all  images  become  confused,  and  our  sight  is
no  less  obscured  than  his  own.  Even  at  moments  of
most  eloquent  description  we  hear  of  institutions  and
magistrates  conveying  no  meaning  to  our  ears,  and  often
see  these  change,  disappear,  and  return  without  grasping
the  why  and  wherefore.  But  when,  on  the  other  hand,
by  the  study  and  imitation  of  ancient  authors,  the  art
of  embracing  a  vaster  circle  of  facts  springs  into  being,
and  the  causes  and  relations  of  those  facts  are  investigated
in  order  to  weld  them  into  visible  unity,  historic  criticism
is  still  lacking  to  verify  events,  to  examine  and  define
laws  and  institutions,  to  colour  and  almost  revive  the  past
in  all  its  varied  and  changeful  aspects.  The  genius  of  the
historian  emits,  as  it  were,  flashes  of  light  ;  but  these,
while  illuminating  some  occasional  point,  only  leave  a
confused  and  uncertain  view  of  past  ages  in  our  mind.
We  require  to  know  men  and  institutions,  parties  and
laws,  as  they  really  were  ;  nor  is  this  enough  :  we  must
also  comprehend  how  all  these  elements  were  fused  into
unity,  and  how  laws  and  institutions  were  begotten  by
those  men  in  those  times.


INTRODUCTION,  ii

This  was  the  task  modern  writers  should  have  per-
formed, but  many  reasons  have  prevented  its  completion.
First  of  all,  the  progress  achieved  by  art  and  literature
while  liberty  was  perishing  in  Florence,  and  their  great
influence  on  all  modern  culture,  fixed  the  principal  atten-
tion of  writers  on  this  section  of  Florentine  history  as  being
one  of  very  general  importance,  and  more  easily  intel-
ligible to  all.  Accordingly,  the  greater  number  of  modern,
and  especially  of  foreign  students  neither  examined  nor
understood  the  precise  period  in  which  all  the  noblest
qualities  of  the  Florentine  nature  had  been  formed,  and
during  which  were  evolved  and  trained  the  intellectual
powers  afterwards  expressed  in  art  and  letters  to  the
admiration  of  the  whole  world.  Many  foreigners  seemed
to  believe  that  art  and  letters  had  not  only  flourished
when  manners  were  most  corrupt,  but  were  almost  the
result  of  and  identified  with  the  corruption  that  led  to
their  decline.  For  the  fine  arts,  being  the  offspring  of
liberty  and  morality,  could  not  long  survive  their  parent
forces.

It  should  be  also  observed  that  no  great  modern
writer  has  yet  produced  any  work  specially  devoted  to
the  political  and  constitutional  history  of  Florence.^  It
must  be  confessed  that  more  than  by  any  modern  pen
was  achieved  to  this  efl'ect  by  the  elder  and  younger
Ammirato,  who,  although  writers  of  the  seventeenth
century,  already  began  to  ransack  State  papers,  and  com-
posed a  work  that  was  new  and  remarkable  at  that
period.     But    they  neither  proposed  to  write  a  history

'  Since  this  paper  first  appeared  many  important  researches  have
been  made  on  the  origin  of  Florence  and  its  Commune,  particularly  by
Professor  D.  O.  Hartwig,  of  whose  estimable  work  we  shall  speak
later  on.  Several  general  histories  of  Florence  have  also  been  pub-
lished, of  which  the  more  noteworthy  are  the  "  Storia  della  Repubblica
di  Firenze,"  by  the  Marquis  Gino  Capponi  (Florence,  Barbara,  1875,
2  vols.),  and  "  L'Histoire  de  Florence,"  by  Mens.  Perrens  (Paris,  1877-90,
q  vols.),  both  to  be  mentioned  farther  on.

of  the  Florentine  constitution,  nor  possessed  sufficient
critical  equipment  for  the  purpose,  had  they  sought  to
fulfil  it.  They  often  overload  new  and  valuable  infor-
mation regarding  events,  and  even  institutions,  with  a
mass  of  useless  detail,  destructive  to  the  general  unity  of
their  narrative.

It  is  scarcely  requisite  to  add  that  modern  writers,  only
treating  of  Florence  in  general  histories  of  Italy,  were
necessarily  compelled  to  pass  briefly  over  secondary  parts
of  their  work.  They  often  relied  too  blindly  on  old
authors  of  acknowledged  repute  and  influence,  without
using  enough  discrimination  in  sifiiing  material  of  un-
deniable value  fi-om  other  parts  composed  of  second-
hand narratives  and  repetitions  of  fabulous  tales.  We
have  only  to  compare  Villani  with  Malespini  to  see  that
one  of  the  two  undoubtedly  copied  many  chapters  from
the  other.  I  Nor  is  this  a  solitary  example.  As  we  have
before  remarked,  Machiavelli  borrowed  whole  chapters
from  Cavalcanti ;  2  Guicciardini  often  translated  from
Galeazzo  Capra,  better  known  under  the  name  of
Capella ;  3      Nardi     reproduced     Buonaccorsi     verbatim.


'  At  the  time  when  this  sentence  was  written  Malespini  was  held  to
be  anterior  to  Villani,  and  the  latter  his  plagiarist.  Later,  the  contrary
was  proved  by  Scheffer-Boichorst,  many  of  whose  arguments  admit  of
no  reply.  But  Marchese  G.  Capponi  refused  to  be  convinced,  on  the
strength  of  certain  indications  establishing,  as  he  thought,  that  Males-
pini had  written  at  an  earlier  date  than  Villani.  Later  again  the  diligent
researches  begun  by  Professor  Lami  confirmed  the  fact  that  Malespini's
work  is  a  compilation,  chiefly,  from  Villani,  and  perhaps,  though  only
here  and  there,  from  some  other  chronicler  of  possibly  earlier  date.  The
latter  hypothesis  would  explain  the  deductions  of  Gino  Capponi.

Therefore,  without  critical  examination  of  these  writers,
and  careful  decision  as  to  their  relative  value  and  the
confidence  to  be  accorded  to  different  parts  of  their
works,  it  is  uncommonly  easy  to  be  misled.  For  this,  and
many  other  reasons,  modern  historians  of  Italy  encounter
numerous  pitfalls  when  treating  of  Florentine  matters.
Now  and  then  we  see  them  halting,  in  common  with
chroniclers  of  the  widest  renown,  to  define  the  precise
functions  of  the  Captain  of  the  people,  or  Podesta,
or  Council  of  the  Commune,  and  afterwards  finding  it
extremely  difficult  to  make  their  definitions  agree  with
actual  facts  whenever  those  titles  recur  in  their  pages.
Such  mistakes  nearly  always  proceed  from  a  double
source.  The  definitions  supplied  by  old  writers  regard-
ing magistrates  and  their  functions  were  extremely  slight,
when  they  alluded  to  their  own  times,  and  often  inexact
where  other  periods  were  in  question.  Also,  modern
writers  generally  demand  a  precise  and  fixed  definition  of
institutions  which  were  subject  to  change  from  the  day
of  their  birth,  and  unalterable  only  in  name.  The  name
not  only  remains  intact  after  the  institution  has  become
entirely  different  from  what  it  was  at  first,  but  often  long
outlives  the  institution  itself.  It  is  curious  to  see  what
ingenious  theories  are  then  started  to  give  substance
and  reality  to  names  now  become  ghosts  of  a  vanished
past.  The  only  way  to  thread  this  labyrinth  is  by
endeavouring  to  reconstruct  the  series  of  radical  changes
every  one  of  those  institutions  underwent,  and  without
once  losing  sight  of  the  mutual  relations  preserved  between
them  during  the  continual  vicissitudes  to  which  they  are
subject.  Only  by  seeking  the  law  that  regulates  and
dominates  these  chang'  s  is  it  possible  to  discern  the
general  idea  of  the  Republic  and  determine  the  value  of
its  institutions.

But  what  can  be  done  while  we  lack  so  many  of  the


14  INTRODUCTION.

elements  most  needed  for  the  completion  of  this  task  ?
The  learned  have  yet  to  arrange,  examine,  and  illus-
trate the  endless  series  of  provisions,  statutes,  consulte^
■pratiche,  ambassadorial  reports,  and,  in  short,  of  all  the
State  papers  of  the  Republic,  many  of  which  are  still
unsought  and  undiscovered.  Nevertheless,  we  believe
that,  without  attempting  for  the  present  any  complete
history  of  Florence,  some  rather  useful  work  may  be
performed.  We  may  certainly  follow  the  guidance  of
old  chroniclers  and  historians  regarding  events  of  which
they  had  ocular  testimony,  trying,  when  needed,  to  temper
their  party  spirit  by  confronting  them  with  writers  of  an
opposite  faction.  Vast  numbers  of  documents  have  been
published  in  driblets,  and  many  learned  dissertations,
although  the  series  is  still  incomplete  ;  besides,  one  may
easily  resort  to  the  Florence  archives  in  order  to  vanquish
difficulties  and  bridge  the  principal  gaps.  And  after
undertaking  researches  of  this  kind,  it  seems  easy  to  us  to
clearly  prove  how  the  whole  history  of  Florence  may  be
illumined  by  a  new  light,  and  its  apparent  disorder  made
to  disappear.  In  fact,  as  soon  as  one  begins  to  carefully
examine  the  veritable  first  causes  underlying  the  apparent,
and  often,  fallacious  causes  of  political  revolutions  in
Florence,  these  revolutions  will  be  found  to  follow  one
another  in  a  marvellously  logical  sequence.  Then  in  the
wildest  chaos  we  seem  rapidly  able  to  discern  a  mathe-
matical succession  and  connection  of  causes  and  effects.
Personal  hatreds  and  jealousies  are  not  causes,  but  only
opportunities  serving  to  accelerate  the  fast  and  feverish
sequence  of  reforms  by  which  the  Florentine  Commune,
after  trying  by  turns  every  political  constitution  possible
at  the  time,  gradually  attained  to  the  highest  liberty  com-
patible with  the  Middle  Ages.  It  is  this  noble  aim,  this
largeness  of  freedom,  that  rouses  all  the  intellectual  and
moral  force  contained  in  the  Republic,  evolves  its  admir-


INTRO D  UCTION,  1 5

able  political  acumen,  and  allows  letters  and  art  and
science  to  put  forth  such  splendid  flowers  in  the  midst  of
apparent  disorder.  But  when  strictly  personal  passions
and  hatreds  prevail,  then  real  chaos  begins,  the  constitu-
tion becomes  corrupt,  and  the  downfall  of  freedom  is  at
hand.

The  sole  aim  of  the  present  work  is  to  offer  a  brief
sketch  of  the  history  of  Florence  during  the  foundation
of  its  liberties.  So  great  is  the  importance  of  the  theme
that  the  historian  Thiers  has  given  long  attention  to  it,
and  we  know  that  an  illustrious  Italian  has  already  made
it  the  object  of  many  years  of  strenuous  research, ^


II.

The  history  of  every  Italian  republic  may  be  divided
into  two  chief  periods  :  the  origin  of  the  commune,  the
development  of  its  constitution  and  its  liberties.  In  the
first  period,  during  which  an  old  state  of  society  is  decaying
and  a  new  one  arising,  it  is  hard  to  distinguish  the  history
of  any  one  commune  from  that  of  the  rest,  inasmuch  as
it  treats  of  Goths,  Longobards,  Greeks,  and  Franks,  who
dominate  the  greater  part  of  Italy  in  turn,  reducing  the
country,  almost  throughout  its  extent,  to  identical  condi-
tions. The  position  of  conquerors  and  of  conquered  is
everywhere  the  same,  only  altered  by  change  of  rulers.
Amid  the  obscurity  of  the  times  and  scarcity  of  informa-
tion, there  seems  scarcely  any  difference  between  one
Italian  city  and  another.  But  differences  are  more
clearly  defined,  and  become  increasingly  prominent  after
the  first  arisal  of  freedom.  Most  obscure,  though  not  of
earliest  date,  was  perhaps  the  origin  of  Florence,  which

tarried  long  before  beginning  to  rise  to  importance.  Our
present  purpose  being  merely  to  throw  light  on  the  history
of  the  Florentine  Constitution,  we  need  not  devote  many
words  to  the  first  period  mentioned  above — namely,  of  the
origin  of  Italian  communes  in  general.  At  one  time
this  question  was  the  theme  of  a  learned,  lengthy,  and
most  lively  dispute,  chiefly  carried  on  by  Italian  and
German  writers.  But  the  scientific  severity  of  researches,
in  which  Italian  scholars  won  much  honour,  was  ofi;en
impaired  by  patriotism  and  national  prejudice.  It
being  recognised  that  the  origin  of  the  Commune  was
likewise  the  origin  of  modern  liberty  and  society,  the
problem  was  tacitly  transformed  into  another  question —
i.e.^  whether  Italians  or  Germans  were  the  first  founders
of  these  liberties,  this  society  ?  It  is  easy  to  understand
how  political  feelings  were  then  imported  into  the  con-
troversy, and  effectually  removed  it  from  the  ground  of
tranquil  debate.

Towards  the  end  of  the  last  century  the  question  was
often  discussed  in  Italy  by  learned  men  of  different  views,
such  as  Giannone,  Maffei,  Sigonio,  Pagnoncelli,  &c.
Muratori,  though  lacking  any  prearranged  system,  threw
powerful  flashes  of  light  on  the  subject,  and  raised  it  to
higher  regions  by  force  of  his  stupendous  learning.  But
the  dispute  did  not  become  heated  until  Savigny  took  up
the  theme  in  his  renowned  "  History  of  Roman  Law  in
the  Middle  Ages."  In  endeavouring  to  prove  the  uninter-
rupted continuity  of  the  said  jurisprudence,  he  was  obliged
— inasmuch  as  all  historical  events  are  more  or  less  con-
nected together — to  maintain  that  the  Italians,  when  subject
to  barbarian  and  even  to  Longobard  rule,  lost  neither  all
their  personal  liberty  nor  their  ancient  rights,  and  that
the  Roman  Commune  was  never  completely  destroyed.
Accordingly,  the  revival  of  our  republics  and  of  Roman
law  was  no  more  than  a  renewal  of  old  institutions  and


INTRODUCTION.  17

laws  which  had  never  entirely  disappeared.  Germany
was  quick  to  see  to  what  conclusions  the  ideas  of  our
great  historian  tended,  and  thereupon  Eichorn,  Leo,
Bethmann,  Karl  Hegel,  and  others,  rose  up  in  arms
against  the  theory  of  the  Italian  Commune  being  of
Roman  birth.  They  maintained,  on  the  contrary,  that
the  barbarians,  and  more  especially  the  Longobards,
whose  domination  was  harsher  and  more  prolonged  than
the  rest,  had  stripped  us  of  all  liberty,  destroyed  every
vestige  of  Roman  institutions,  and  that,  consequently,  the
new  communes  and  their  statutes  were  of  new  creation,
and  originally  derived  from  Germanic  tribes  alone.

To  all  appearance  these  views  should  have  stirred
Italian  patriotism  to  furious  opposition,  and  made
Savigny's  ideas  universally  popular  among  us.  Yet  this
was  not  the  case.  We  supplied  many  learned  adherents
to  either  side.  At  that  time  our  national  feeling  had  just
awakened  ;  we  already  desired — nay,  claimed — a  united
Italy,  no  matter  at  what  cost,  and  detested  everything  that
seemed  opposed  to  our  unity.  Well,  the  Longobards
had  been  on  the  point  of  mastering  the  whole  of  Italy,  and
the  Papacy  alone  had  been  able  to  arrest  their  conquests  by
securing  the  aid  of  the  Franks.  But  for  this,  even  the
Italy  of  the  ninth  or  tenth  century  might  have  become
as  united  a  country  as  France.  Already  the  school  of
thinkers  had  been  revived  among  us  that,  even  in  Machia-
velli's  day,  had  regarded  the  Pope  as  the  fatal  cause  of

!  Italy's  divisions.  Therefore,  naturally  enough,  while  con-
futing Savigny's  views,  our  nineteenth-century  Ghibel-
lines  exalted  the  Longobards,  ventured  to  praise  their
goodness  and  humanity,  and  hurled  invectives  against  the
Papacy  for  having  prevented  their  general  and  permanent
conquest  of  Italy.  But,  on  the  other  hand,  there  was  also
a  political  school  that  looked  to  the  Pope  as  the  future
saviour  of  Italy,  and  this  school,  prevailing  later  on  during

the  revolution  of  1848,  adopted  the  opposite  theory,  and
possessed  two  most  illustrious  representatives  in  Manzoni
and  Carlo  Troya.  At  any  rate,  they  had  little  difficulty
in  proving  that  barbarians  had  been  invariably  barbaric,
killing,  destroying,  and  trampling  down  all  things,  and
that  the  Papacy,  by  summoning  the  Franks,  no  matter
for  what  end,  had  certainly  rendered  some  help  to  the
harshly  oppressed  masses.  The  Franks,  in  fact,  gave
some  relief  to  the  Latin  population,  sanctioned  the  use
of  Roman  law  and  granted  new  powers  to  Popes  and
bishops,  who  undoubtedly  contributed  to  the  revival
of  the  communes.  Thus,  although  for  opposite  ends,
identical  opinions  were  maintained  on  both  sides  of
the  Alps.  Throughout  this  controversy  learning  was
always  subordinated  to  political  aims,  although  the  dis-
putants may  not  have  been  always  aware  of  it ;  and
historic  truth  and  serenity  consequently  suffered  unavoid-
able hurt.  Balbo,  Capponi,  and  Capei,  after  throwing
their  weight  on  this  side  or  that,  ended  by  holding  very
temperate  views,  and  their  teachings  cast  much  light  on
the  point  at  issue.

The  main  difficulty  proceeds  from  the  fact  that  few
persons  are  willing  to  believe  that  in  the  Middle  Ages,  as
well  as  throughout  modern  history,  we  can  always  trace
the  continuous  reciprocal  action  of  the  Latin  and  German
races,  and  that  it  is  impossible  to  award  the  merit  of  any
of  the  chief  political,  social,  or  literary  revolutions  ex-
clusively to  either.  On  the  contrary,  wherever  the  abso-
lute predominance  of  one  of  the  two  races  seems  most
undoubted,  we  have  ro  tread  with  most  caution,  and  seek
to  discover  what  share  of  the  work  was  due  to  the  other.
Likewise,  in  order  to  justly  weigh  and  determine  their
reciprocal  rights  in  history,  impartial  narrative  would  have
a  better  chance  of  success  than  any  system  based  on
political  ideas.    Assuredly,  when  facts  are  once  thoroughly


INTRODUCTION,  19

verified,  no  system  is  needed,  since  general  ideas  result
naturally  from  facts.  Were  it  allowable  to  introduce  here  a
comparison  with  far  younger  times,  we  might  remark  that
when  French  literature  invaded  Germany  in  the  eighteenth
century  it  obtained  general  imitation  there,  and  unex-
pectedly led  to  the  revival  of  national  German  literature.
In  order  to  glorify  the  national  tone  of  this  literature,
would  it  be  necessary  to  maintain  that  the  great  previous
diffusion  of  French  writings  was  only  imagined  by  his-
torians? Later,  the  French  flag  was  flaunted  in  nearly
every  city  of  Germany,  and  the  people  humiliated  and
crushed.  From  that  moment  we  see  the  national  German
spirit  springing  to  vigorous  life.  Must  we  say  that  this
revival  was  due  to  the  French }  Is  it  not  better  to  de-
scribe events  as  they  occurred,  rejecting  all  foregone  con-
clusions ?  I  am  quite  aware  of  the  abyss  between  these
recent  events  and  those  of  old  days  ;  but,  nevertheless,
I  consider  that  Balbo  was  right  in  remarking  that
the  fact  of  the  origin  of  the  communes  being  disputed
at  such  length  and  with  so  much  heat  and  learning
by  the  two  rival  schools,  proved  that  the  truth  was
not  confined  exclusively  to  either.  Accordingly,  we
will  rapidly  sum  up  the  conclusions  we  deem  the  most
reasonable.

Every  one  knows  that,  after  the  earlier  barbarian
descents,  by  which  the  Empire  was  devastated,  and  Rome
itself  frequently  ravaged,  Italy  endured  five  real  and
thorough  invasions.  Odoacer,  with  his  mercenary  horde,
composed  of  men  of  diff^erent  tribes,  but  generally  desig-
nated as  Heruli,  was  the  leader  who  dealt  the  mortal
blow  in  476,  and  becoming  master  of  Italy  for  more  than
ten  years,  scarcely  attempted  to  govern  it,  and  only  seized
a  third  of  the  soil.  But  a  new  host  poured  in  from  the
banks  of  the  Danube,  commonly  styled  Goths,  and  sub-
divided  into   Visigoths   and   Ostrogoths.      The    former


i  6  INTRO D  UCTION.

division,  commanded  by  Alaric,  had  already  besieged
and  sacked  Rome  ;  the  latter,  led  by  Theodoric,  appeared
in  489,  and  speedily  subjected  all  Italy  Theodoric's
reign  was  highly  praised.  The  chiefs  of  these  early
barbarian  tribes  had  often  served  for  many  years  in
Roman  legions,  and  had  sometimes  been  educated  in
Rome.  Accordingly  they  felt  a  genuine  admiration  for  the
majesty  of  the  very  empire  that  the  heat  of  victory  now
urged  them  to  destroy.  Theodoric  organised  the  govern-
ment ;  and,  according  to  the  barbarian  custom,  seized
a  third  of  the  land  for  his  men ;  but  he  left  the  Romans
their  laws  and  their  magistrates.  In  every  province  a
count  was  at  the  head  of  the  government,  and  held
jurisdiction  over  the  Ostrogoths.  The  Romans  were
ruled  according  to  their  own  laws,  and  these  laws  ad-
ministered by  a  mixed  tribunal  of  both  races.  But  Theo-
doric's government  became  gradually  harsher  and  more
intolerable  to  the  Romans,  so  that,  after  his  death,  they
revolted  against  his  successors,  and  invoked  the  aid  of
the  Greeks  of  the  Eastern  Empire.  But  revolt  brought
them  nothing  save  increased  suffering,  inasmuch  as  the
Goths  began  to  murder  the  Romans  in  self-defence,
deprived  them  of  what  liberty  and  institutions  they  had
been  allowed  to  retain,  and  organised  a  military  and
absolute  government.  This  was  the  government  Beli-
sarius  and  Narses  found  established  on  coming  from
Constantinople  to  deliver  and  reconquer  Italy ;  this  wa
the  government  they  copied  with  their  dukes,  or  duces.
The  Ostrogoths  had  ruled  Italy  for  fifty-nine  years
(493-552),  and  the  Greeks  held  it  for  sixteen  more
(552-568).  Theirs  also  was  a  purely  martial  govern-
ment, under  the  General  -  in  -  chief  Narses,  but  with
dukes,  tribunes,  and  inferior  judges  nominated  by  the
Empire.  As  usual,  the  newcomers  appropriated  a  share
of  the  soil,  and   probably   this  share  now  went  to  the


INTRO  D  UCTION.  2 1

State.  Their  tyranny  was  different  from  that  of  the
barbarians,  but  it  was  the  tyranny  of  corrupt  rulers,  and
therefore  more  cruel.  The  Greeks  had  expelled  the  Goths,
and  next  came  the  Longobards  to  drive  out  the  Greeks.
They  gradually  extended  their  conquests,  and  in  fifteen
years  became  masters  of  three-fourths  of  Italy,  leaving  only
a  few  strips  of  land,  mainly  near  the  sea,  to  the  Greeks
whom  they  never  succeeded  in  expelling  altogether.  The
Longobards  struck  deep  roots  in  Italian  soil,  and  dwelt
on  it  for  more  than  two  hundred  years  (568-773),  ruling
in  a  very  harsh  and  tyrannous  fashion.  They  took  a
third  of  the  land,  reduced  the  Italians  almost  to  slavery,
and  respected  neither  Roman  laws  nor  Roman  institutions.
Beneath  their  sway  the  ancient  civilisation  seemed  anni-
hilated, and  the  germs  of  a  newer  one  were  prepared,
although  its  first  budding  forth  is  still  involved  in  much
obscurity.  Every  controversy  as  to  the  origin  of  our
communes  started  from  inquiries  into  the  condition  of
the  Italians  under  the  Longobard  rule.  If  ancient  tradition
were  at  any  time  really  broken  off  and  replaced  by  a
totally  new  one,  it  must  have  occurred  under  that  rule.
Or,  if  it  only  underwent  a  great  change  before  assuming
new  life  and  vigour  at  a  later  time,  the  process  must  have
dated  from  the  same  period.

Nevertheless,  wherever  the  Byzantine  domination  had
obtained,  a  feebler  and  more  vacillating  government  weighed
less  cruelly  on  the  people  ;  therefore,  as  early  as  the
seventh  and  eighth  centuries,  certain  cities  were  seen  to
develope  new  life.  The  Commune  speedily  took  shape,
even  in  Rome,  where  the  power  of  the  Papacy,  hostile  to
the  Longobards,  had  greatly  increased.  On  first  coming
among  us,  these  barbarians  of  the  Arian  creed  respected
neither  the  Catholic  bishops,  the  minor  clergy,  nor  any-
thing sacred  or  profane,  and  later  on  menaced  the  Eternal
City  itself     Accordingly,  as  a  means  of  defence  against

the  threatening  enemy  at  his  gates,  the  Pontiff  summoned
the  Franks  to  save  the  Church  and  country  from  op-
pression. They  came  in  obedience  to  this  call,  led  first
by  Pepin  and  then  by  Charlemagne,  who,  driving  out  the
Longobards,  and  fortifying  the  Papacy  by  grants  of  land,
enabled  the  Pope  to  inaugurate  his  temporal  dominion.
In  reward  for  this  Charlemagne  was  crowned  emperor ;
and  thus  the  ancient  Empire  of  the  West  was  re-established
by  the  new  Empire  of  the  Franks,  to  which  the  Holy
Roman-Germanic  Empire  afterwards  succeeded.

Thereupon  the  dissolution  of  barbarian  institutions,
already  begun  in  Italy,  proceeded  at  a  more  rapid  pace.
There  was  a  ferment  in  Italian  public  life,  heralding  the
approach  of  a  new  era.  Institutions,  usages,  laws,
traditions  of  all  kinds — Longobard,  Greek,  Frankish,
ecclesiastical,  Roman — were  found  side  by  side  and  jumbled
together.  Next  ensued  a  prolonged  term  of  violence  and
turmoil,  during  which  the  name  of  Italy  was  scarcely
heard.  All  old  and  new  institutions  seem  at  war,  all
struggling  in  vain  for  supremacy,  when  suddenly  the
Commune  arises  to  solve  the  problem,  and  the  era  of
freedom  begins.  But  what  gave  birth  to  the  Commune  ?
This  is  the  question  by  which  we  are  always  confronted.

It  would  be  outside  our  present  purpose  to  follow  the
learned  scholars  who  have  sought  to  deduce  ingenious  and
complicated  theories  from  some  doubtful  phrase  in  an  old
codex,  or  the  vague  words  of  some  chronicler.  It  is
certain  that  the  Roman  Empire  was  an  aggregation  of
municipalities  exercising  self-government.  The  city  was
the  primitive  atom,  the  germ-cell,  as  it  may  be  called,  of
the  great  Roman  society  that  began  to  disperse  when  the
capital  lost  the  power  of  attraction  required  to  bind
together  so  great  a  number  of  cities  separated  by  vast
tracts  of  country  either  totally  deserted,  or  only  inhabited
by  the  slaves  cultivating  the  soil,.     The  barbarians,  on  the


INTRODUCTION.  83

other  hand,  knew  nothing  of  citizen  life,  and  the  Gau  or
Comitatus  (whence  the  term  contado  is  derived),  only  com-
prising embryo  towns,  or  rather  villages,  which  were  some-
times burnt  when  the  tribes  moved  on  elsewhere,  re-
sembled the  primitive  nucleus  of  Teutonic  society.  In
the  comitatus  the  count  ruled  and  administered  justice
with  his  magistrates ;  the  chiefs  of  the  soldiery  were
his  subordinates,  and  became  barons  later  on.  Several
countships  joined  together  formed  the  dukedoms  or
marquisates  into  which  Italy  was  then  divided,  and  the
whole  of  the  invading  nation  was  commanded  by  a  king
elected  by  the  people.

When,  therefore,  the  Germanic  tribes  held  sway  over
the  Latin,  the  Gau  held  sway  over  the  cities  which  indeed
formed  its  constituents.  And  the  counts,  as  military
chieftains,  ruled  the  conquered  land,  of  which  the  victors
appropriated  one-third.  The  Goths  pursued  the  same
plan ;  so  too  the  Greeks,  who  replaced  all  counts  by
their  own  duces  ;  and  so  also  the  Longobards.  Only
the  latter's  rule  was  far  more  tyrannous,  especially  at
first,  and  their  history  is  very  obscure.  They  began  by
slaughtering  the  richest  and  most  powerful  Romans ;  they
seized  one-third  of  the  revenues,  it  would  seem,  instead  of
the  lands,  thus  leaving  the  oppressed  masses  without  any
free  property,  and  consequently  in  a  worse  condition  than
before.  The  Goths  had  permitted  the  Romans  to  live  in
their  own  way,  but  the  Longobards  respected  no  laws,
rights,  nor  institutions  of  the  vanquished  race.  On  this
head  Manzoni  remarks  i  that  no  mention  is  found  of  any
Italian  personage,  whether  actual  or  imaginary,  in  connec-
tion with  any  royal  office  or  public  act  of  the  time.
Nevertheless,  from  absolute  tyranny,  and  even  downright
subjection,  to  the  total  destroyal  of  every  Roman  law,
right,  and  institution,  there  is  a  long  step.     In  order  to

attribute  to  the  Longobards — numbering,  it  is  said,  some
130,000  souls  in  all — the  total  extinction  of  Roman
life  in  every  direction,  we  must  credit  them  with  an
administrative  power,  far  too  well  ordered  and  dis-
ciplined, too  steadfast  and  permanent,  to  be  any  way
compatible  with  their  condition.  How  could  a  tribe
incapable  of  comprehending  Roman  life  persecute  it  to
extinction  on  all  sides?  Granting  even,  although  this  is
another  disputed  point,  that  the  Romans  were  deprived
of  all  independent  property  ;  granting  that  Roman  law
was  neither  legally  recognised  nor  respected  by  the
Longobards,  it  by  no  means  follows  that  every  vestige
of  Roman  law  and  civilisation  was  therefore  destroyed  at
the  time.  Far  more  just  and  credible  seems  the  opinion
of  other  writers  who  have  maintained  that  when  the
Longobards  descended  into  Italy  they  thought  chiefly  of
their  own  needs,  made  no  legal  provision  for  the  Italians,
and  were  satisfied  with  keeping  tl\em  in  subjection. i
Thus,  in  all  private  concerns,  and  in  matters  beyond  the
grasp  of  the  barbarian  administration,  the  conquered
people  could  continue  to  live  according  to  the  Roman
law  and  in  pursuance  of  ancient  customs.  In  fact,
Romans  and  Longobards  lived  on  Italian  soil  as  two
separate  nations  ;  the  fusion  of  victors  and  vanquished,
so  easy  elsewhere,  is  seen  to  have  been  difficult  in  Italy,
even  after  the  lapse  of  two  centuries.  So  great  is  the
tenacity  and  persistence  of  the  Latin  race  among  us,  that
it  is  easier  to  reduce  the  conquered  to  slavery,  or  extirpate
them  altogether,  than  to  deprive  them  of  their  individu-
ality. In  fact,  whenever,  by  the  force  of  things,  and  by
long  intercourse,  conquerors  and  conquered  come  into
closer  contact,  the  barbarians  are  unavoidably  driven  to
make  large  concessions  to  the  Latin  civilisation,  which
even  when  apparently  extinguished  is  always  found  to  have

life.  How  explain  otherwise  the  gradual  yielding  of
Longobard  law  to  the  pressure  of  Roman  law ;  how
explain  the  new  species  of  code  that  gradually  took  shape,
and  was  styled  by  Capponi  an  almost  Roman  edifice  built
upon  Germanic  foundations  ?

As  the  Longobards  became  more  firmly  established  in
Italy,  they  began  to  inhabit  the  cities  which  they  had
been  unable  to  entirely  destroy ;  they  also  began  to
covet  real  property,  and  accordingly,  during  the  reign
of  their  king  Autari,  instead  of  a  third  of  the  revenues,
seized  an  even  larger  proportion  of  the  land.  This
measure  aggravated  the  condition  of  the  vanquished  on
the  one  hand,  but  greatly  improved  it  on  the  other,  by
leaving  them  in  possession  of  some  independent  property. ^
And  although,  as  Manzoni  observed,  we  find  no  royal
officials,  great  or  small,  of   Roman  blood,  it  is  no  less

'  Everything  connected  with  the  division  of  the  land  has  been  the
theme  of  much  dispute,  both  in  Italy  and  abroad.  It  was  learnedly
treated  by  Troya,  in  his  work  on  the  "  Condizione  dei  Romani  vinti  dai
Longobardi " ;  Capponi  and  Capei  discussed  it  with  much  subtlety  in
their  "Lettere  sui  Longobardi"  (appendix  of  the  "  Archivio  Storico
Italiano,"  vols.  i.  and  ii.) ;  so  too  Manzoni,  Balbo,  &c.  The  question  turns
on  the  interpretation  of  two  passages  in  "  Paulus  Diaconus."  The  passage
alluding  to  the  first  division  made,  when  the  Longobards  seized  one-
third  of  the  revenues  of  the  land,  is  clear  enough  :  "His  diebus  multi
nobilium  Romanorum  ob  cupiditatem  interfecti  sunt.  Reliqui  vero  per
hospites  divisi,  ut  terciam  partem  suarum  frugum  Langobardis  persol-
verent,  tributarii  efficiuntur."  But  the  other  is  much  less  clear,  and  has
been  variously  interpreted.  This  is  the  reading  most  generally
adopted:  "  Hujus  in  diebus"  {i.e.,  in  Autari's  reign)  "ob  restaurationem
Regni,  duces  qui  tunc  erunt,  omnem  substantiarum  suarum  mediatatem
regalibus  usibus  tribuunt  ;  populi  tamen  agravati  per  langobardos
hospites,  partiuntur."  But  a  tenth-century  version,  in  the  Ambrosian
Codex,  runs  as  follows :  "  Aggravati  pro  Longobardis,  hospitia  partiun-
tur." The  division  of  the  land  {hospitia),  and  not  of  the  fruits  of  the  land,
would  seem  more  clearly  indicated  in  this  second  reading,  accepted
by  Balbo.  Prof.  Capei,  on  the  other  hand,  while  accepting  the  first
reading,  asserts  that  the  word  partiuntur  should  be  interpreted  in  an
active  sense.  The  conquered  divided  ihelr  lands  with  their  conquerors,
and  therefore  were  oppressed  {agoravati),  being  compelled  to  yield  one-
half  of  their  estates,  but  they  had  at  least  the  advantage  of  retaining
the  other  half  in  their  own  possession.

certain  that  the  Longobards,  having   need  of  manners,
builders,    and    artisans,   were    obliged    to    make  use  of
Romans  and  their  superior  skill  in  those  capacities.     It
was  in  this  way  that  the  ancient  scholae,  or  associations
of  craftsmen,  continued  to  survive  throughout  the  Middle
Ages,  as  we  know  to  have  been  the  case  with  the  magistri
comacinij  or  Guild  of  Como  Masons,  to  whose  skill  the
conquering   race    had   frequent    recourse.      In    however
rough  and  disorderly  a  fashion  these  associations  contrived
to  withstand  the  barbarian  impact,  they  were  certainly  an
element  of  the  old  civilisation,  and  kept  the  thread  of  it
unbroken.      Other  remains  and  traditions  of  that  same
civilisation  also  clung  about  them ;  and  when  every  other
form  of  government  or  protecting  force  was  lacking  to
the  inhabitants  of  cities,  these  associations  guarded  the
public  welfare  to  some  extent.     Do  we  not  find  that  an
ancient  municipality,  when  first  left  to  its  own  resources,
sometimes  closed  the  city  gates  against  the  barbarians,  and
defended  itself,  almost  after  the  manner  of  an  indepen-
dent state  ?     Was  it  not  sometimes  successful  in  repul-
sing  the   foe?      Even  when   conquered,  trampled,    and
crushed,  can  we  suppose  it  to  have  been  destroyed  every-
where alike,  or  so  thoroughly  cancelled  from  the  memory
of   the   Latins,   that,    on   seeing   it   reappear,    we   must
attribute  its  resurrection  to  Germanic  tribes,  to  whom  all
idea  of  a  city  was  unknown  until  they  had  invaded  our
soil?     Did  not  the  resuscitation  of  the  Greek  cities  of
Southern  Italy  begin  as  far  back  as  the  seventh  and  eighth
centuries — namely,  in  the  time  of  the  Longobards — and
assuredly  without  the  help  of  Germanic  traditions  ?     Did
not  the  Roman  Commune  arise  at  the  same  period?     And
if  the  ancient  municipalities,  fallen  beneath  the  Longobard
yoke,    and    therefore    more    cruelly    oppressed,    delayed
almost  four  centuries  longer,  did  they  not  also  follow  the
example   of  their   fellow-cities   at    last?      What   is   the

meaning  of  the  widely  spread  tradition,  that  only  in  that
paragon  of  independent,  free  republics,  Byzantine  Amalfi,
were  preserved  the  Roman  Pandects,  which  were  then
captured  by  Pisa,  and  cherished  as  her  most  valued
treasure  ?  Does  not  the  whole  subsequent  history  of
the  Commune  consist  of  the  continual  struggle  of  the
re-born  Latin  race  against  the  descendants  of  Teuton
hordes  ?  If  Latin  civilisation  had  been  utterly  destroyed,
how  came  it  that  the  dead  could  rise  again  to  combat  the
living  ?  Therefore,  it  seems  clear  to  us  that,  although
the  Longobards  accorded  no  legal  rights  to  the  conquered
people,  they  could  not  practically  deprive  them  of  all  ;
they  either  tolerated  or  were  unaware  of  many  things,
and  the  tradition,  usage,  and  persistence  of  the  race  kept
alive  some  remnants  of  Latin  civilisation.  Thus  alone
can  it  be  explained  how,  after  enduring  a  harsh  and  long-
continued  tyranny  that  apparently  destroyed  everything,
no  sooner  were  a  few  links  snapped  off  the  strong,
barbaric  chain,  by  which  the  Italian  population  was  so
straitly  bound,  than  Latin  institutions  sprang  to  new  life,
and  regained  all  the  ground  they  had  lost.

Barbarian  society,  both  in  form  and  tendency,  was
essentially  different  from  the  Latin.  Its  predominant
characteristic  was  the  so-called  Germanic  individualism,
as  opposed  to  the  Latin  sociability.  We  note  a  prevalent
tendency  to  divide  into  distinct  and  separate  groups.  As
a  body,  it  no  sooner  lost  the  force  of  cohesion  and  union
induced  by  the  progress  and  rush  of  conquest,  than  it
immediately  began  to  be  scattered  and  disintegrated.
Owing  to  their  nomadic  and  savage  life,  as  well  as  to
the  blood  in  their  veins,  the  barbarians  seemed  to  have
inherited  an  exaggerated  personality  and  independence,
making  it  difficult  for  them  to  submit  for  long  to  a
common  authority.  Thus,  when  peace  was  established,
germs  of  enfeebhng  discord  soon  appeared  among  them.


28  INTRODUCTION.

In  fact,  when  the  Longobards  had  completed  the  con-
quest of  nearly  the  whole  of  Italy,  they  divided  the  land
into  thirty-six  Duchies,  governed  by  independent  dukes
enjoying  absolute  rule  in  their  respective  territories.
Under  the  dukes  were  sometimes  counts,  residing  in
cities  of  secondary  importance,  and  at  the  head  of  the
comitati ;  while  still  smaller  cities  were  often  ruled  by  a
scuUascius,  or  bailiff.  Both  dukes  and  bailies  administered
justice  according  to  the  Longobard  code,  together  with
the  assistant  judges,  who,  under  the  Franks,  developed  into
scabini^  or  sheriffs.  Little  by  little  military  leaders  gained
possession  of  the  strongholds,  and  subsequently  became
almost  independent  chiefs.  Then,  too,  the  royal  officials,
styled  gasindi,  likewise  exercised  great  power.,  And  even
as  the  dukes  finally  asserted  their  independence  from  the
king,  so  counts  and  sculdasci  sought  emancipation  from
the  ducal  sway,  although  without  immediate  success.  In
the  first  century,  after  the  conquest,  there  was  no  law,  no
recognised  protection  for  the  vanquished,  nor  was  the
authority  of  the  bishops  and  clergy  in  any  way  respected.
The  history  of  the  Longobard  rule  shows  it  to  have  been
so  tremendously  oppressive  as  to  apparently  crush  the  very
life  of  the  people,  so  that  even  at  the  most  favourable
moments  no  serious  revolts  were  attempted.  Even  the
example  of  the  free  cities  in  the  South  failed  to  excite  them.
Nevertheless,  as  we  have  already  noted,  the  Church,
having  gained  meanwhile  a  great  increase  of  power,
refused  to  tolerate  the  pride  and  arrogance  of  barbarians
who  showed  her  so  little  respect.  Hence  the  Pope
resolved  to  expel  these  strangers  by  the  help  of  others,
and  called  the  Franks  into  Italy.  Charlemagne,  the
founder  of  the  new  Empire,  could  not  regard  the  Latins,
to  whom  the  growing  civilisation  of  his  states  was  so
much  indebted,  with  the  inextinguishable  barbarian  con-
tempt felt  by  the  Longobards.     He  sought  to  extend  his


INTRODUCTION.  29

conquests  and  his  power.  He  wished  to  assist  the  Pope,
in  order  to  be  consecrated  by  him  and  obtain  his  moral
support.  Therefore  he  came  to  Italy,  and  the  already
disintegrated  Longobards  could  ill  withstand  the  firm
unity  of  the  Franks,  strengthened  as  it  was  by  the  pres-
tige of  his  own  victories.  In  vain  the  Longobards  had
already  chosen  and  sworn  fealty  to  another  monarch  ;  in
vain  they  prepared  for  defence.  After  two  hundred  and
five  years  of  assured  and  almost  unchecked  domination,
their  kingdom  was  overthrown  for  ever.  In  774  Charle-
magne became  master  of  Italy,  and  in  the  year  800  was
crowned  emperor  by  the  Pope  in  Rome.  Thus  the
Western  Empire  became  reconstituted  and  consecrated  in
a  new  shape,  entirely  separate  and  independent  from  the
Empire  of  the  East.  The  Franks  deprived  the  Longo-
bards of  all  their  dominions,  excepting  the  Duchy  of
Benevento  in  Southern  Italy.  The  power  of  the  Pope
was  greatly  increased  by  his  assumption  of  the  right  of
anointing  the  emperor,  who  rewarded  him  with  rich
donations  and  promised  additions  of  territory.  Rome,
however,  was  ruled  as  a  free  municipality  ;  and  Venice,
after  the  manner  of  the  Greek  cities  in  the  South,  had
already  asserted  her  freedom.  Such  was  the  state  of  Italy
after  the  last  barbarian  invasion — that,  namely,  of  the
Franks.

As  usual,  the  new  masters  appropriated  one-third  of
the  land  ;  but  the  condition  of  the  natives  was  now
decidedly  changed  for  the  better.  Roman  law  was
recognised  as  the  code  of  the  vanquished,  and  this  is
an  evident  sign  that  it  was  never  entirely  obsolete  during
the  two  centuries  of  Longobard  rule.  Charlemagne
greatly  improved  the  condition  of  the  Latins,  and  some-
times promoted  them  to  honours.,  i.e.,  to  offices  of  royal
appointment.  But  the  special  characteristic  of  his  reign
in  Italy  was  the  new  hierarchy  he  established  there.     He


30  INTRODUCTION.

destroyed  the  power  of  the  dukes,  whose  attitude  was  too
threatening  to  the  unity  of  the  Empire,  and  raised  instead
the  position  of  the  counts.      Even  in  the   Marches,  or
border-provinces,  he  retained  no  dukes,  but  replaced  them
by  marquises  (Mark-grafen,  Praefecti  limitum).     In  this
manner  the  ancient  unity  of  the  comitatus^  or  Gau,  became
likewise  the  basis  of  the  new  barbarian  society.     Nor  did
Charlemagne  stop  at  this  point,  but  began  to  distribute
offices,  lands,  and  possessions  in  beneficio — i.e.^  in  fief — and
therefore  on  condition  of  obligatory  military  service.  This
proved   the    beginning   of  a    social   revolution,    possibly
originated  at  an  earlier  date,  but  now  carried  to  com-
pletion under  the  name  of  feudalism.     Not  the  emperor
only,  but  kings,  counts,  and  marquises  also  granted  lands,
revenues,  and  offices  in  fief,  in  order  to  obtain  a  sufficient
supply  of  vassals.      Thus   an   infinite   number   of  new
potentates  was  created  :  vassalli^  vahassori,  and  valvas-
sinij  the  latter  being  lowest  in  degree.     Gradually  the
whole  society  of  the  Middle  Ages  took  a  feudal  shape  ;
the  recipient  of  a  grant  of  land  was  bound  to  yield  mili-
tary service,  at  the  head  of  the  peasants  employed  on  his
ground.      Similar  privileges,  similar  obligations,  accom-
panied every  donation  of  land  or  bestowal  of  office  ;  for
even   official   posts   were    generally   supplemented   by   a
concession  of  land  or  of  revenue.     Thus  the  Germanic
tendency  to  division  and  subdivision  in  small  groups  was
satisfied,  while,  at  the  same  time,  the  Empire,  the  cities,
and   even   the    Church    itself,   assumed    a   feudal   form.
The  bishops  in  their  turn  soon  began  to  possess  benefices,
and  gradually  rose  to  increased  power,  until  we  find  them
in  the  position  of  so  many  counts  and  barons.     Both  in
their  own  persons,  and  those  of  their  subordinates,  they
enjoy  immunity   from  ordinary  laws    and   tribunals — an
inestimable  advantage,  serving  to  enhance  their  independ-
ence and  unite  large  clusters  of  population  beneath  their


INTRO  D  UCTION.  3 1

sheltering  sway.  Feudalism,  accordingly,  is  a  new  order,  a
new  and  thoroughly  Germanic  aristocracy,  yet  at  the  same
time  it  is  the  root  of  a  veritable  revolution  in  barbaric
society,  the  which  revolution  will  continue  to  grow  and
extend  through  many  vicissitudes.  Step  by  step  the
Crown  will  begin  to  exempt  the  benefices  or  fiefs  of  the
vassals  from  subjection  to  the  count,  and  will  then  declare
them  hereditary  by  means  of  a  series  of  laws,  all  designed
for  the  purpose  of  irritating  the  lesser  potentates  against
their  superiors,  and  of  giving  increased  strength  to  the
royal  authority ;  but  which  served,  on  the  contrary,  to  open
a  way  of  redemption  to  the  downtrodden  people.  All  this,
however,  was  still  unforeseen  in  the  days  of  Charlemagne.
He  organised  the  feudal  system,  and  kept  his  realm  united
and  flourishing,  although  soon  after  his  death  {814)  the
Empire  was  split  into  several  kingdoms.

The  rule  of  the  Franks  in  Italy  lasted  to  the  death  of
Charles  the  Fat,  in  888.  And  throughout  this  rule  of
115  years,  the  revolution  to  which  we  have  alluded
was  steadily  making  way.  On  all  sides  the  number
of  benefices  or  fiefs  continually  grew,  and  year  by  year
exemptions  increased  at  an  equal  rate.  These  were  con-
ceded more  easily  to  prelates  than  to  others,  since  when
laymen  received  benefices  they  were  entitled  to  leave
them  to  their  heirs,  and  thus  became  inconveniently
powerful.  This  state  of  things  proved  very  favourable
to  cities  in  which  bishops  held  residence.  At  first
the  count  was  sole  ruler  of  the  city,  save  the  portion
appertaining  to  the  Crown,  and  called  gastaldiale^  as  being
under  the  command  of  a  gastaldo,  or  steward  ;  then,  as
the  power  of  the  bishop  increased,  another  portion  was
exempted  from  the  count's  jurisdiction,  as  being  vescovile^
i.e.y  the  property  of  the  bishop.  Step  by  step  this  portion
was  enlarged  until  it  included  nearly  the  whole  of  the
town  :    many  cities,  in   fact,   were   ruled    solely  by   the


32  INTRODUCTION,

bishop.  Thus  the  fibres  of  barbarian  society  were
weakened,  and  we  might  ahiiost  say  unknit,  by  a  method
that  woiild  have  served  to  keep  it  in  subjection  to  the
supreme  authority  of  the  monarch,  but  for  the  fact  that
the  people,  deemed  to  be  dead,  was  not  only  breathing,  but
on  the  point  of  asserting  its  strength  against  nobles,  kings
and  emperors,  prelates,  and  Popes.

Two  revolts  in  the  cause  of  liberty  successively  took
place,  and  both  began  under  the  Carlovingians,  and  con-
tinued during  the  reigns  of  their  successors.  The  first
enervated  and  enfeebled  the  barbarian  society  to  which
the  soil  of  Italy  was  so  ill  suited  ;  the  second  prepared
the  way  for  the  rise  of  communes.  With  the  death  of
Charles  the  Fat  the  rule  of  the  Franks  lapsed,  and
barbarian  invasions  likewise  ceased.  The  Germanic  tribes
had  settled  down  on  Italian  soil  and  were  becomincr  civi-
lised.  Nevertheless,  Italy  had  still  to  pass  through  a  string
of  revolutions  and  years  of  ill  fortune.  At  the  dissolution
of  the  Empire  of  the  Franks,  certain  counts  and  marquises,
especially  the  latter,  who,  by  the  union  of  several  counties,
had  gained  the  power  of  dukes,  were  found  asserting
extravagant  pretensions,  even  endeavouring  to  form  inde-
pendent states,  and  often  with  success.  To  this  day,  in
fact,  there  are  reigning  families  descended  from  Frankish
marquises  and  counts.  To  compass  their  destruction
benefices  and  immunities  had  been  granted  in  vain  :  their
power  was  not  to  be  so  easily  extinguished.  For,  even  in
Italy,  where,  owing  to  the  different  character  of  the  country,
the  ancient  civilisation  had  tenaciously  lingered  on,  and  now
began  to  awake  to  new  life,  and  where,  too,  the  Papacy
and  the  Greeks  of  Byzantium  had  impeded  the  absolute
triumph  of  Germanic  institutions,  feudal  counts  and  mar-
quises now  arose  to  contest  the  crown.  Next  followed  long
years  of  renewed  devastation  and  conflict,  ending  by  the
crown  being  retained  in  the  grasp  of  German  emperors  and


INTRODUCTION.  33

kings.  The  first  wars  and  quarrels  were  carried  on  by
Berengarius  of  Friuli  and  Guido  of  Spoleto,  with  other
Italian  and  foreign  nobles,  a  German  king,  two  Burgundian
monarchs,  and  finally  by  King  Otho  of  Germany,  who
remained  victor.  It  was  during  these  seventy  odd  years
of  continued  strife  that  Italian  kings  first  reigned  in  Italy,
though  with  an  always  uncertain  and  disputed  rule.  Then
came  a  forty  years'  peace  (961-1002),  during  which  Otho
I.,  II.,  III.  reigned  in  turn,  and  another  Italian  marquis,
Hardouin  of  Ivrea,  disputed  the  crown  of  Italy  with  the
German  kings.  But  in  10 14  Hardouin  was  vanquished
by  Henry  of  Germany,  surnamed  the  Saint^  to  whom
succeeded  Conradin  of  the  Franconian  or  Salic  dynasty.

These  two  German  sovereigns  completed  the  feudal
revolution,  already  mentioned  by  us,  the  which,  begun  by
the  Carlovingians,  and  continued  by  the  Othos,  had  failed
nevertheless  to  assure  the  supremacy  of  kings  and  emperors
over  Italy.  But,  at  all  events,  seeing  that  the  Othos  had
purposely  exempted  numerous  lesser  vassals  from  render-
ing allegiance  to  the  counts  and  barons,  and  had  accorded
many  cities  to  prelates  ;  also  seeing  that  the  renascence
of  communes  was  considerably  promoted  by  all  the  afore-
said exemptions,  some  writers  conceived  the  idea  that  this
renascence  was  chiefly  owed  to  the  initiative  of  the  Othos.
But  these  emperors  had  a  very  different  aim  in  view,  and
had  failed  to  achieve  it.  They  sought  to  undermine  the
strength  of  all  possible  assailants  of  the  Crown,  when
threatened  by  revolts  such  as  that  of  the  Marquis  of
Ivrea.  For  this  reason  Henry  the  Saint  continued  to
favour  the  greater  feudatories  at  the  expense  of  "  holders
of  honours  " — that  is  to  say,  of  counts  and  marquises —
and  in  fact  almost  annihilated  the  latter  class.  Con-
radin the  Salic  carried  out  the  scheme  more  completely,
by  favouring  even  the  minor  feudatories  and  making
benefices  hereditary.     From  that   moment  the  victory  of

4


34  INTRODUCTION.

the  German  sovereigns  over  the  feudal  lords  was  assured  ;
for  vassals  once  rendered  masters  of  their  fiefs  owed
obedience  to  the  Crown  alone,  and  thus  the  pride  of  the
great  nobles  was  permanently  abased.  Not  so  the  new
popular  pride,  which  had  grown  to  be  a  power  unawares.

Accordingly,  we  find  a  multitude  of  facts  showing  that
the  condition  of  the  Roman  race  was  continually  improv-
ing ;  that  feudal  society,  by  the  action  of  its  own  sove-
reigns, was  daily  losing  substance  and  strength  ;  that  as
the  Latin  civilisation  revived  by  the  natural  force  of
events,  it  changed,  assimilated,  and  absorbed  the  principles
of  Germanic  society.  Even  before  the  two  races  came
into  conflict,  the  traditions  of  the  conquered  had  frequently
combated  and  overcome  those  of  victors.  The  latter,
indeed,  had  already  accepted  the  Roman  law  to  some
extent,  when  the  once  subject  race  pleaded  the  sanction
of  their  municipal  statutes.

Italians  were  in  a  state  of  ferment  and  of  radical  trans-
formation when  the  first  signs  of  a  revival  of  the  communes
appeared.  Neither  the  barbarian  rule  nor  the  Empire
had  ever  really  mastered  the  social  order  of  the  peninsula  ;
and  exactly  when  feudalism  was  first  founded  and  seemed
likely  to  spread  everywhere  and  assure  the  quiet  supre-
macy of  the  emperors  over  Italy,  fresh  causes  of  peril  and
strife  suddenly  sprang  into  existence.  Papacy  and  clergy
attained  to  loftier  and  more  menacing  power  ;  the  immuni-
ties lavished  on  prelates,  from  dread  of  the  laity,  rendered
them  temporal  potentates  dependent  on  the  emperors,
while  as  spiritual  dignitaries  they  owed  obedience  to  the
Pope  :  thus  practically  enjoying  a  double  investiture.  This
led  to  much  disorder  and  scandalous  corruption  in  the
Church,  since  prelates  were  converted  into  feudal  lords,
holding  sway  over  cities,  making  war  on  other  territories,
keeping  open  court,  and  indulging  in  every  worldly  plea-
sure.    The  Popes  wished   to   re-establish   discipline,   to


INTRODUCTION.  35

maintain  absolute  rule  over  the  bishops,  and  nominate
them  unhindered  ;  but  this  was  opposed  by  the  emperor,
since  the  temporal  authority  of  the  prelates  made  them
logically  subject  to  his  rule  as  well.  Thus  began  the
famous  war  of  investitures  between  the  Papacy  and  the
Empire,  the  issue  of  which  was  so  long  undecided.  Mean-
while neither  the  Church,  the  Empire,  nor  the  feudal
system  could  obtain  complete  mastery  over  the  social
movement,  and  the  confusion  was  increased  by  their  con-
tinual disputes.  This  state  of  things  weakened  even  the
authority  of  the  prelates  ;  and  then  the  communes,  having
necessarily  learnt  the  art  of  self-government  during  the
period  when  dioceses  were  left  vacant,  having  noted  the
prosperity  of  the  Southern  republics,  and  found  their
strength  increased  by  the  extension  of  commerce  and  the
feudal  disorganisation,  finally  saw  that  the  moment  to
achieve  freedom  had  arrived.  Even  in  cities  ruled  by  lay
nobles,  things  followed  the  same  course,  since  to  side
either  with  the  Empire  or  the  Church  always  served  to
excite  much  enmity  against  those  in  power,  and  procured
many  allies  for  the  weaker  party.

Accordingly  the  eleventh  century  witnessed  the  arisal  ot
communes  throughout  Italy,  and  the  joy  of  independence
once  realised,  it  was  impossible  to  return  to  a  state  of
vassalage,  whether  under  bishops,  counts,  or  the  Empire
itself.  At  first  these  communes  were  hemmed  in  on  all
sides  by  a  vast  number  of  dukes,  counts,  and  barons  of
various  degrees  of  strength,  inasmuch  as  the  feudal  order
was  still  very  powerful  and  still  supreme  in  all  country
districts.  Of  German  descent  and  trained  to  arms,  these
nobles  fought  in  their  own  interest,  although  nominally
for  the  Empire  and  its  rights,  against  the  new  communal
order  that  suddenly  faced  them  with  such  menacing  strength.
They  swooped  down  from  their  strongholds  to  bar  the
trade  of  the  towns  ;  they  levied  tolls,  threatened  violence,


36  INTRODUCTION.

and  tried  to  treat  free  men  as  their  vassals.  Thereupor
the  indignant  citizens  were  stirred  to  vengeance  from  timt
to  time,  and  often  ended  by  razing  great  fortresses  to  th(
ground.  On  the  other  hand,  the  nobles  still  remaininc
in  the  cities  became  wearied  of  living  among  men  wh(
no  longer  respected  the  distinctions  of  class  or  race,  anc
often  departed  to  rejoin  their  friends.  They  frequently
emigrated  in  such  numbers  that  the  citizens  suffered  injury
by  it,  and  issued  decrees  forbidding  their  exodus.  Th(
Pope  gave  encouragement  to  the  communes,  because  th(
reduction  of  his  prelates'  temporal  power  did  not  displease
him,  and  the  abasement  of  the  Empire  was  indispensable
to  his  aims.  Thus  the  struggle  of  the  working  classe;
against  feudalism  finally  began,  and  with  it  the  real  histor)
of  our  communes.

But  it  should  not  be  thought  that  the  Commune  arose
to  champion  the  rights  of  man  or  in  the  name  of  nationa
independence.  Nothing  of  the  kind.  The  Empire  wa;
still  held  to  be  the  sole  and  universal  fount  of  right
Almost  to  the  close  of  the  fifteenth  century,  in  fact,  all  cities
whether  Guelph  or  Ghibelline,  foes  or  friends  of  the
Empire,  continued  to  indite  their  State  papers  in  its  name.'

won.  Nor  was  the  destruction  of  the  Empire  at  any  time
desired  by  the  Popes  ;  its  protection  was  often  indispens-
able to  them,  and  they  too  recognised  it  as  the  legitimate
heir  of  ancient  Rome,  and  consequently  as  the  only  source

of  political  and  civil  rights.  Their  purpose  was  to  subject
the  temporal  to  the  spiritual  power.  Therefore,  during
the  rise  of  the  Commune,  theocracy  and  feudalism,  Papacy
and  Empire,  still  subsisted  together  and  always  in  conflict.
The  Commune  had  to  struggle  long  against  obstacles  of
all  kinds  ;  but  it  was  destined  to  triumph,  and  to  create
the  third  estate  and  people  by  whom  alone  modern  society
could  be  evolved  from  the  chaos  of  the  Middle  Ages,
This  constitutes  the  chief  historical  importance  of  the
Italian  Commune.


CHAPTER    I.


THE  ORIGIN  OF  FLORENCE.


I.

HE  origin  of  Florence  is  wrapped  ii
great  obscurity,  and  little  light  is  to  b^
derived  from  chroniclers,  who  eithe
avoided  the  subject  altogether  or  cloudec
it  over  with  legends.  Much  has  beei
written  of  late  touching  these  chronicler
and  on  the  value  and  varying  credibility  of  their  accounts
But  in  endeavouring  to  ascertain  everything,  and  pus]
research  too  subtly,  long  and  learned  disputes  have  some
times  arisen  on  particulars  which  can  never,  perhaps,  h
verified  and  are  scarcely  worth  knowing,  while  mor
significant  and  easily  investigated  points  have  been  lef
untouched.  By  this  method  some  risk  is  incurred  o
building  up  from  those  writers  a  species  of  occult  scienc
for  the  sole  benefit  of  the  initiated,  whereas  all  that  i
absolutely  known  of  the  origin  of  Florence  may  b
expressed  in  a  few  words.

The  Florentine  Commune  being  of  tardier  birth  thrii
many  others  its  historians  and  chroniclers  were  likewis
of  later  date,  since  no  commune  possesses  a  writtei
history  until  conscious  of  its  own  personality.  Thus,  i
was  only  in  the  twelfth  century  that  yearly  records  wer
first    started,    registering    some    of   the    more    importan

events  of  Florence,  giving  dates,  and  names  of  places  am

persons,  while,  at  the  same  time,  lists  were  made  of  the
Consuls,  the  first  magistrates  of  the  Commune,  and  after-
wards supplemented  with  the  names  of  the  Podesta,  who
succeeded  to  the  Consuls.  These  magistrates  being
changed  yearly,  and  even  more  frequently,  this  catalogue
served  as  a  chronological  guide,  and  was  soon  converted
into  a  register  of  contemporaneous  events  in  the  town.

A  very  early  fragment  of  these  annals  is  preserved  in
the  Vatican,  and  is  written  on  the  back  of  a  sheet  form-
ing part  of  a  codex  ^  of  Longobard  laws.  It  contains
eighteen  records,  running  from  1 1 10  to  1 173,  in  different
handwritings,  all,  however,  of  the  twelfth  century,  with
some  blunders  and  no  chronological  arrangement.  Never-
theless these  records  are  of  much  importance,  being  the
earliest  we  possess.  A  similar  and  longer  series  of  records
of  much  later  date,  running  from  1107  ^°  ^247,  is  to  be
found  in  a  thirteenth-century  MS. 2  in  the  National  Library
at  Florence.

Both  collections  have  been  recently  republished  and
illustrated  by  Dr.  Hartwig,  under  the  title  of  **  Annales
florentini,"  i.  and  '*  Annales  florentini,"  ii.3  The  Codex
containing  the  second  series  also  comprises  the  oldest  list
extant  of  Consuls  and  Podesta,  from   1196  to  1267,  and

•  Codex  772  of  the  Vatican  Palatine  Library,  containing  the  so-called
Lombard  collection  of  Longobard  laws.  The  discovery  of  the  Florentine
annals  on  the  back  of  sheet  71  is  owed  to  the  librarian  Foggini.  He
communicated  his  find  to  Professor  Lami,  who  published  part  of  the
fragment,  with  notes.  The  whole  was  afterwards  edited  by  Professors
Pertz  and  Hartwig,  and  finally  Professor  C.  Paoli  issued  an  exact  photo-
type of  the  fragment  in  No.  i  of  the  "  Archivio  paleografico  Italiano,"
edited  by  Prof.  Monaci,  of  Rome.

^  This  is  a  codex  from  Santa  Maria  Novella,  now  No.  Tjd,  E.  A.
(Suppressed  Monasteries  section),  of  the  Magliabecchian  Library.  It
consists  of  forty-six  records,  part  of  which  (the  first  twenty-five,  down  to
the  year  1217)  were  published  by  Fineschi  in  his  "  Memorie  Storiche
degli  uomini  illustri  di  S.  M.  Novella,''  vol.  i.  pp.  330-332.

der  Stadt  Florenz."  Part  i.  of  this  work  was  published  in  Marburg,
1875  ;  part  ii.,  containing  both  series  of  annals,  at  Halle,  1880.


40  THE  ORIGIN  OF  I'LORENCE,

has  been  rendered  more  complete  by  the  results  of  fresh
research.!

Other  and  similar  records  must  have  been  certainly
made,  first  in  Latin,  then  in  Italian,  and,  in  passing  from
this  family  to  that,  from  hand  to  hand,  enlarged,  revised,
and  altered  according  to  the  taste,  or  even  the  fancy,  of
their  transcribers.  But,  from  the  remains  of  those  records
and  all  matter  copied  from  them  by  the  chroniclers,  it
may  be  inferred  with  almost  absolute  certainty  that  they
told  little  or  nothing  of  the  origin  of  the  Commune.  We
are  therefore  inclined  to  believe  that  this  was  neither  the
outcome  of  virulent  conflict  nor  of  downright  revolution,
for  either  would  have  been  undoubtedly  registered  in  the
annals,  but  that  it  gradually  evolved  and  developed  amid
struggles  of  secondary  importance.

If  in  these  days  we  desire  to  ascertain  the  origin  of  the
Florentine  Commune,  it  is  only  natural  that  older  genera-
tions should  have  felt  even  a  keener  interest  in  the  theme.
They,  however,  lacked  the  art  and  critical  method  enabling
us  to  track  and  often  lay  bare  the  darkest  and  most
remote  periods  of  history  by  means  of  public  documents,
although  many  now  perished  must  have  been  at  their
disposal.  But  our  forefathers  were  readier  to  draw  on
their  own  imagination,  and  thus  a  legend  regarding  the
origin  of  the  city  was  created,  and  soon  became  widely
diflxised.

The  primary  germ  from  which  this  legend  was  de-
veloped and  expanded  must  date  from  the  twelfth  century,
seeing  that  it  was  known  and  recorded  by  the  chronicler
Sanzanome,  who  wrote  during  the  first  years  of  the
thirteenth  century.  It  cannot  be  much  older  than  this,
seeing  that  the  events  and  dates  to  which  it  alludes,  in

'  First  published  by  Fineschi  (op.  cit.,  vol.  i.  p.  257)  and  afterwards  by
Hartwig  (ii.  185  and  fol.),  with  many  notes  and  additions.  Some  new
nanies  of  Consuls  are  contained  in  the  so-called  "  Chronicle  "  of  Brunetto
Latini,  to  be  mentioned  later  on.


EARL  Y  LEGENDS.  41

however  vague  and  shadowy  a  fashion,  carry  it  down
beyond  the  eleventh  century.  Several  inedited  copies  of
this  legend  are  still  to  be  found  in  Florentine  libraries,  ^
and  it  has  been  published  in  three  different  compilations.
The  most  ancient  of  these,  in  Latin,  is  contained  in  a
codex  dating  from  the  end  of  the  thirteenth  or  beginning
of  the  fourteenth  century. 2  The  second,  m  Italian,  is  in
a  Lucchese  MS., 3  compiled  between  1290  and  1342  ;  at
one  point  it  gives  a  record  of  1264,4  and  was  probably
written  at  that  time.  The  third  and  later  version,  known
as  the  "  Libro  fiesolano,"  is  comprised  in  an  Italian  codex
dated  1382,  in  the  Marucellian  Library  at  Florence,  was
discovered  by  Signor  Gargani  and  published  by  him  in
1854.5  Dr.  Hartwig  discovered  the  second,  which  is
identical,  save  in  language,  with  the  first,  and  published
all  three  under  the  title  of  "  Chronica  de  Origine  Civi-
tatis,"  6  found  in  the  Lucca  MS. ;  although  in  other  MSS.
it  is  styled  *'  Memoria  del  Nascimento  di  Firenze."

Such  was  the  material  at  the  service  of  the  old  chroni-
clers, and  all  they  had  to  rely  upon  regarding  the  origin
of  Florence.  The  earliest  chronicler  of  whom  any
remains  are  extant  is  the  judge  and  notary  Sanzanome,
who,  as  already  noted  by  us,  wrote  his  **  Gesta  Florenti-
norum  "  at  the  beginning  of  the  thirteenth  century.  We
find  him  mentioned  more  than  once  in  Florentine  docu-


'  One  was  discovered  by  Pro,  C.  Paoli  in  the  Laurentian  Library,

by  the  late  Prof.  Lami,  who  intended  to  mention  them  in  an  essay  on

ments  from  1 188-1245. '  Although  we  cannot  be  certain
that  this  name  always  referred  to  the  same  individual,  it
is  certain  that  the  same  chronicler  records  his  presence
in  the  war  of  Semifonte  in  the  year  1202,  and  in  that  of
Montalto  in  1207.  Besides,  his  work  is  found  in  a
Florentine  codex  of  the  thirteenth  century,  and  if  not  in
his  own  hand,  in  the  character  of  about  the  same  period. ^
This  first  attempt  at  Florentine  history,  written  in  Latin
by  a  judge  and  notary,  supposed  by  Milanesi  and  Hart-
wig  to  have  been  a  native  of  a  neighbouring  town,  but
resident  in  Florence,  has  a  stamp  of  its  own,  very  different
from  that  of  all  subsequent  Florentine  chronicles.  Sanza-
nome  says  nothing  as  to  the  origin  of  the  Commune  and
its  internal  constitution.  After  a  vague  and  hasty  allusion
to  the  old  legend, 3  he  starts  with  the  war  and  destruction
of  Fiesole  in  1 125,  *'  cum  eius  occasione  Florentia  sump-
sisset  originem."  Thus,  from  the  beginning,  he  shows  us
the  Commune  already  established,  with  its  consuls  and
captains,  and  proceeds  to  recount  its  conflicts  with
neighbouring  powers  in  a  stilted,  rhetorical  fashion,  with
uncertain  and  often  erroneous  dates,  and  with  speeches  in
strained  imitation  of  ancient  Roman  historians.  Conse-
quently some  writers  refused  to  assign  any  historic  value
to  his  work.  But,  on  the  other  hand,  critics  of  greater
weight  and  impartiality,  such  as  Hartwig,  Hegel,  and
Paoli,  have  recognised  that  the  work  of  this  notary,  who

'  Vide  Professor  Santini,  in  pt.  i.  doc.  18  of  his  forthcoming  work,
gives  a  document  dated  June  14,  11 88,  with  the  signature,  "  Ego  Sanza-
nome  index  et  notarius."  In  the  Acts  of  the  Tuscan  League  of  11 97
(Santini,  vol.  i.  21,  p.  37)  we  find  the  name  of  "Sanzanome  de  Sancto
Miniato"  among  the  signatures  following  that  of  the  Consul  of  San
Miniato.

'  Professor  Paoli  makes  the  same  statement  in  his  before-mentioned
work.  The  Codex  in  question  is  the  Magliab.-Strozz.,  CI.  xxv.  571.  The
"Gesta  "  were  published  about  the  same  time  by  Hartwig  (op.  cit.)  and
by  the  Tuscan  "  Deputazione  di  Storia  patria"  (Cellini,  1876).

EARLY  CHRONICLERS.  43

was  almost  a  precursor  of  the  fifteenth-century  humanists,
is  a  literary  phenomenon,  and  that  the  fact  of  its  isolation
makes  it  the  more  remarkable  as  a  proof  of  ancient
Florentine  culture,  and  also  because  we  find  beneath  its
rhetorical  flourishes  much  useful  information  on  the  early
history  of  Florence.

Hence  all  the  other  chroniclers  had  to  face  one  and
the  same  problem  :  how  to  write  a  history,  or  even  a
bare  chronicle  of  the  earliest  beginnings  of  Florence,  from
the  scant  and  fragmentary  accounts  at  their  disposal  ?
The  notary  Sanzanome  shirked  the  difficulty  by  saying
nothing  of  the  foundation  of  the  town,  and  then  expand-
ing his  narrative  with  rhetorical  flights,  fictitious  speeches,
and  descriptions  of  battles,  in  which  his  own  fancy  and
imitation  of  the  classics  played  the  main  part.  But  this
method  was  neither  congenial  nor  possible  to  the  simpler
folk  of  a  later  day,  who  sought  to  write  as  they  spoke,
and  whose  culture  was  slighter,  or  at  all  events  very  dif-
ferent from  the  notary's.  These  chroniclers,  therefore,  had
no  basis  to  build  upon  save  one  legend  and  a  few  scraps
of  information  that  could  not  possibly  satisfy  their
patriotic  pride.

Fortunately  for  their  purpose,  just  at  this  time — namely,
towards  the  middle  of  the  thirteenth  century — an  event  of
great  literary  importance  occurred,  serving  to  put  the
Florentine  chroniclers  on  a  new  track.  A  Dominican
monk,  one  Martin  of  Troppau,  in  Bohemia,  surnamed
therefore  OppaviensiSy  vulgarly  known  as  Martin  Polono,
chaplain,  apostolic  penitentiary,  and  afterwards  archbishop,
wrote  an  historical  work  which,  although  of  no  remark-
able merit,  had  an  extraordinary  and  rapid  success.  It
was  a  species  of  manual  of  universal  history,  chronologi-
cally arranged  under  the  names  of  the  various  emperors
and  Popes,  down  to  the  year  1268.  Its  author  afterwards
carried  it  down  to  a  few  years  later,  with  an  introduction


44  THE  ORIGIN  OF  FLORENCE.

treating   of  the   times  anterior  to  the   Roman   Empire,  i
This  book  was  mechanically  arranged,  and  stuffed  with
anecdotes,  blunders,  and  fables  ;  but  was  the  work  of  an
eminent  prelate,  inspired  with  the  Guelphic  spirit.     The
author's  method  of  arranging  the  events  of  the  Middle
Ages  under  the  headings  of  Popes  and  Emperors  served
as   a  leading  thread   through   the  vast  labyrinth.      It  is
certain    that   his    book  was   rapidly  diffused   throughout
Europe,  especially  in  Italy,  and  above  all  in  Florence.    As
Prof   Scheffer  Boichorst   remarks  :    *'  Its   first    translator
was  a  Florentine,  and  another  Florentine,  Brunetto  Latini,
the  first  to  make  use  of  it."    In  fact,  the  Florence  libraries
have  numerous  copies  of  it  in  Latin  MSS.  of  the  four-
teenth century,  while  others  of  the  same  period  comprise
an   Italian  translation   that,   according   to  the  results  of
learned  research,^  must  have  been  produced  in  Florence
towards  1279.3    This  fact  alone  is  a  most  luminous  proof
of  the  rapid  popularity  and  diffusion  of  the  work.     As  it
was  a  common  practice  with  the  scribes  of  that  period  to
insert  alterations  of  their  own  in  the  works  they  copied
out,  it  may  have  easily  occurred  to  some  transcriber  of
this  translation  to  enrich  it  here  and  there  with  the  more
important  of  the  few  facts  then  known  of  the  early  history
of  their  city.     But  as   Martin  Polono's   work  was  only
brought  down  to  the  end  of  the  thirteenth  century,  and
items  of  Florentine  history  had  increased  in  number  and
extent,  so  it  came  about  that  all  these  additions  forsook  uni-
versal history  and  were  solely  devoted  to  that  of  Florence.

"  Florentiner  Studien."

3  Prof.  Santini,  who  gave  much  attention  to  the  subject,  discovered  in
Florence  twelve  copies  of  Martin  Polono,  and  three  of  its  translations,  all
of  the  fourteenth  century.  Other  copies  have  been  found  since  by  Prof.
Lami.


MARTIN  POLONO.  45

In  this  way  the  former  merely  served,  as  it  were,  as  an
introduction  to  the  latter ;  a  result  highly  gratifying  to
municipal  self-complacency.

One  of  the  first  works  introducing  Martin  Polono's
book,  translated,  shortened,  re-written,  and  with  several
interpolated  Florentine  items,  is  that  entitled  "  Le  Vite
dei  Pontefici  et  Imperatori  Romani,"  once  attributed  to
Petrarch,  and  existing  in  several  Florentine  fourteenth-
century  codices.  In  this  work,  however,  Florentine
history  is  still  given  very  secondary  importance,  and  indeed
when  at  last,  after  various  sequels  and  alterations,  it  finally
appeared  in  print  in  1478,  Polono's  primitive  method  was
still  maintained  by  giving  summaries  here  and  there  of  the
lives  of  the  other  emperors  and  Popes.  But  other  versions
soon  appeared  in  which  Florentine  history  filled  a  larger
space. *  In  a  fourteenth-century  MS.  of  the  Naples
National  Library,  first  examined  by  Pertz,  we  find
Martin  Polono's  share  of  the  work  considerably  curtailed,
and  the  history  of  Florence  not  only  much  extended,  but
likewise  carried  down  to  1309.2  Here  one  begins  to  see
that  the  writer  was  chiefly  interested  in  Florentine  events.
Professor  Hartwig  was  so  struck  by  this  fact  as  to  be  at
the  pains  to  extract  everything  relating  to  Florence  from
the  MS.,  and  print  it  apart,  as  one  of  the  authorities  pro-
bably recurred  to  by  Villani.3  In  a  chronicle  attributed
to  Brunetto  Latini  the  same  purpose  is  still  more  clearly
indicated.     Some  of  the  Florentine  news  contained  in  it

'  "  Impressum  Florentiae  apud  Sanctum  Jacobum  de  Ripoli,  Anno
Domini  mcccclxxviii."  Other  editions  were  produced  in  the  sixteenth
century.  Prof.  Santini  has  discovered  three  fourteenth-century  MSS.  of
this  work  in  Florence.

"  The  Naples  Codex  is  marked  xiii.-F.  16.  A  similar  codex  of  the
fifteenth  century,  carried  down  to  the  death  of  Henry  of  Luxemburg,  is
in  the  Laurentian-Gaddiano  Collection,  cxix.

3  In  pt.  ii.  of  his  "  Quellen,"  &c.,  where  these  extracts  are  given
under  the  title  of  "Gesta  Florentinorum  und  deren  Ableitungen  und
Fortsetzungen."


46  THE  ORIGIN  OF  FLORENCE,

were  long  and  frequently  extracted,  printed,  and  employed ;
notably  the  list  of  Consuls  and  Podesta  used  by  Ammi-
rato,  and  a  narrative  of  the  Buondelmonti  tragedy  (12 15),
differing  considerably  from  Villani's  version  of  the  tale.
It  was  speedily  decided  that  the  author  must  have  written
in  1293,  since  he  records  an  event  of  that  year,  and  says
that  he  witnessed  it  with  his  own  eyes.i  Later,  this
Chronicle  was  attributed  to  Brunetto  Latini,  although  the
narrative  is  carried  down  to  a  date  when  Dante's  master
must  have  certainly  ceased  to  exist.2  During  his  learned
researches  in  Florence  Dr.  Hartwig  discovered  a  MS.
that,  in  all  probability,  is  the  original  autograph  of  the
Chronicle.3  Although  mutilated — starting  only  from
1 181 — this  Codex  is  doubly  precious,  as  it  clearly  shows
the  method  on  which  this  and  many  similar  works  were
compiled.  There  is  a  middle  column  containing  the  usual
mangled  version  of  Martin  Polono  4  ;  and  here  on  the
margins,  between  the  rubrics  and  sometimes  even  the
lines,  are  added  notices  of  general  history,  drawn  from
other  sources,  and  special  records  of  Florentine  events.

The  history  is  thus  brought  down  to  1249,  where  ^  g^P
occurs  extending  to  1285,  ^J*om  which  year  the  author
continues  his  narrative  to  1303.5     But  in  this  second  part

•  In  mentioning  certain  Saracen  nobles,  sent  as  prisoners  that  year
alia  Chiesa  di  Rovta,  he  adds  :  "  et  to gli  viddi"  ("and  I  beheld  them").

=  It  comes  down  to  1303,  but  the  concluding  paragraph  seems  to  be
written  by  a  later  hand.  But  the  preceding  paragraph  narrates  events  of
1297,  and  Brunetto  Latini  certainly  died  before  then  (1294).

*  This  has  also  been  clearly  proved  by  Prof.  Santini's  numerous  veri-
fications.

5  Two  very  short  records,  or  rather  notes,  were  added  by  another  hand
where  the  gap  occurs,  namely  :  "  Pope  Adrian  V.,  born  of  the  Fiesco
family  of  Genoa,  1276,  reigned  as  Pope  thirty  days  ;  the  Chair  vacant
twenty-eight  days.  Pope  Innocent  VI.  elected,  who  came  from
Portugal."  The  second  note  is  certainly  erroneous.  Innocent  VI.
(Etienne  d'Albert)  was  a  Frenchman  of  Limousin  birth,  and  was
raised  to  the  Papacy  in  1352.  But  Adrian's  successor  was  John  XXI.,
a  Portuguese.     The  author  mistook  Johannes  (probably  written  in  an


MARTIN  POLO  NO.  47

the  character  of  the  work  is  entirely  changed.  Having
no  longer  Martin  Polono  as  a  guide,  he  now  forsakes  that
prelate's  method.  The  affairs  of  the  Empire  and  the
Church  are  reduced  to  still  smaller  proportions,  more
space  is  given  to  those  of  Florence,  and  instead  of  being
scattered  haphazard  over  the  narrative,  they  are  now
united  and  carried  steadily  on.  Thus  we  see  a  real
chronicle  of  Florence  gradually  developing  before  us  and
acquiring  a  special  value  of  its  own.  Its  discoverer,  Dr.
Hartwig,  at  first  considered  it  an  autograph,  but  finally
conceived  doubts  on  that  score.  The  great  disorder  ot
the  manuscript ;  its  mutilated  commencement ;  the  gap
between  thirty-six  years  in  the  middle  ;  the  absence  of
certain  records,  comprised  in  certain  excerpts  from  it,
quoted  by  old  writers  ;  the  discovery  that  many  of  these
writers  quoted  from  another  MS.  of  the  Chronicle  belong-
ing to  the  Gaddi  Library  ;  all  this  justified  his  statement
that  the  problem  could  not  be  finally  solved  without  the
aid  of  the  Gaddi  Codex,  which  he  had  not  yet  been  able
to  discover.

On  the  other  hand.  Professor  Santini  maintained,  in  a
prize  essay,  that  the  Gaddi  Codex  could  only  be  a  copy  of
that  found  by  Hartwig,  and  that  the  latter  must  be  the
mutilated  original  manuscript.  After  a  short  time  the
question  was  ultimately  decided  by  another  student  of  our
Istituto  Superiore,  Signor  Alvisi,  who,  having  unearthed
the  Gaddi  Codex  in  the  Laurentian  Library,  found  it  to  be
a  fifteenth-century  copy.^     Here  the  various  fragments —

abbreviated  form)  for  Innocentius,  XXI.  for  VI.  Even  in  other  chronicles
the  two  records  stand  together,  and  ahnost  in  the  same  words,  but  with-
out the  same  blunder.

'  Codex  Laur.  Gadd,  77.  On  the  back  are  these  words:  "Cronica
romanorum  Pontificum  et  Imperatorum."  This  title  explains  the  connec-
tion of  the  Chronicle  with  Martin  Polono,  and  why  the  MS.  so  long
escaped  the  researches  of  students  of  Florentine  history.  The  work  of
Professor  Santini  from  which  we  have  quoted  being  an  essay  sent  in
for  his  B.A.  examination,  was  discussed  at  the  Istituto  Superiore,  and

arranged  in  separate  columns  in  the  original  MS. — are
joined  with  the  remainder  of  the  text,  though  often  in  an
arbitrary  fashion.  Here,  too,  there  is  the  gap  between
1249-85,  but  the  Chronicle,  instead  of  starting  from  1 181,
begins,  like  Martin  Polono's  first  compilation,  with  Jesus
Christ — ■primo  e  sommo  Fontefice — and  the  Emperor  Octa-
vian.  Thus,  it  may  now  be  affirmed,  that  the  Codex  in
the  Florence  National  Library  is  a  genuine  and,  as  it
were,  photographic  representation  of  the  method  employed
for  the  earliest  compilations  of  Florentine  historiography.
It  allows  us  to  see  the  author  at  work,  as  it  were,  before
our  eyes.

Another,  but  far  less  perfect,  specimen  of  this  kind  of
production  is  afforded  by  the  Lucca  MS.,  to  which  pre-
vious allusion  has  been  made.  The  author  carefully  tells
us  that  it  was  composed  between  the  years  1290  and  1342.
He  transcribes  the  whole  legend  of  the  origin  of  Florence,
and  then  gives  his  Italian  pasticcio  of  Martin  Polono,
beginning  from  the  Emperor  Octavian.  But  he  inter-
sperses it  with  "  many  things  relating  to  the  affairs  of
Tuscany,  and  especially  of  Florence  .  .  ,  the  greater  part
being  found  in  divers  books  on  Tuscany,  of  which  some
contain  more,  some  less "  {qual  na  piu,  qual  na  meno).
Having  reached  the  year  1309  in  this  fashion,  he  con-
tinues his  narrative  by  borrowing  from  Villani,  several
books  of  whose  history  had  already  appeared  in  1341,
and  with  this  assistance  carries  his  work  down  to  1342.
He  continues  by  reproducing  a  Latin  description  of
Florence  written  in  1339,  and  then  gives  the  Latin  intro-

an  account  given  of  it  in  the  "Arch.  Stor.  It.,"  Series  iv.  vol.  xii.  No.  iv.
p.  483  and  fol.,  1883.  The  paper  itself  has  remained  unpublished,  as
Alvisi's  discovery  made  its  demonstrations  superfluous.  Santini  regarded
the  Chronicle  as  one  of  great  importance,  since  it  records  the  names  of
certain  consuls,  omitted  in  all  the  others,  but  contained  in  newly  dis-
covered documents,  now  in  type,  and  forming  part  of  the  work  that  will
soon,  we  hope,  be  published  by  Signor  Santini.


PAOLO  FIERI.  49

duction  that  Martin  Polono  had  added  to  his  history.
The  compiler  of  this  Lucca  Codex  avows  that  his  method
is  neither  logical  nor  chronological;  but  craves  the  reader's
indulgence,  saying  that  in  this  work  he  had  first  put
together  all  the  Italian  and  then  all  the  Latin  portions,
with  the  intention  of  arranging  them  better  afterwards,  by
fijsing  them  together  and  writing  the  whole  in  Latin.
This  intention  he  seems  to  have  found  no  time  to  fulfil.
From  this  Codex  also,  all  the  portions  relating  to  Florence
were  subsequently  extracted  and  printed. ^  As  may  be
seen,  the  compiler's  method  is  always  the  same,  although
in  this  case  heavier  and  more  mechanical  than  usual,  for
lack  of  any  inherent  connection  between  the  different
parts.  The  only  novelty  consists  in  transcribing  the
entire  legend  to  make  it  serve  as  an  introduction  to
Florentine  history  ;  an  example  that,  as  will  be  seen,  was
afterwards  followed  by  others.

But  however  flattering  to  Florentine  self-love  this  system
of  fusing  the  history  of  the  Commune  with  that  of  the
universe  might  be,  it  was  clearly  apparent  that  the  former
remained  crushed,  as  it  were,  by  the  contact.  Hence
even  the  fourteenth  century  witnessed  attempts  to  expound
it  apart.  Paolo  Fieri  begins  his  Chronicle  from  1080,  the
year  from  which  the  other  writers  also  date  their  earliest
historical  account  of  Florence,  and  continues  it,  with
slight  allusions  to  the  Popes  and  slighter  to  the  emperors,
down  to  1305,  including  the  scanty  Florentine  records
*'  gleaned  from  many  chronicles  and  books,  with  certain
novel  matters  seen  by  me,  Paolino  di  Piero,  and  written
ad  memoriamy  On  the  other  hand,  Simone  della  Tosa,
who  died  in  1380,  begins  his  "Annals"  with  a  list  of
Consuls  and  Podesta  (i  196-1278),  and  then  passes  to  the

'  Baluzio  Manzi,  "  Miscellanea,"  torn.  iv.  This  Orsucci  Codex,  in  the
Lucca  Archives,  has  been  very  minutely  described  by  Hartwig  (vol.  i.
XXX.  and  fol.),  who,  as  before  mentioned,  brought  out  the  Italian  version
of  the  legend  he  had  extracted  from  it.

death  of  Countess  Matilda  {1115)  and  on  to  1346,  sup-
plementing towards  the  close  his  meagre  account  of  Floren^
tine  affairs  with  details  about  his  own  family.  But  simple
summaries  such  as  these,  consisting  only  of  a  few  pages
were  more  inadequate  than  ever  to  satisfy  the  needs  of  {
city  that  now,  in  the  fourteenth  century,  had  already  wor
a  foremost  place  in  Italy,  was  proudly  asserting  equalit]
with  Rome,  and  aspired  to  have  a  history  similar  to  tha
of  the  ancient  metropolis  of  the  world.

Such  was  the  ambitious  problem  that  Giovanni  Villani
as  shown  by  his  own  words,  proposed  to  solve.  In  th(
year  1300,  he  says,  "  being  in  Rome  for  the  Jubilee,  ad-
miring the  grand  memories  of  that  city,  reading  thi
glorious  deeds  narrated  by  Virgil,  Sallust,  Lucan,  Titu
Livy,  Paul  Orosio,  and  other  masters  of  history,  wh<
recounted,  not  the  events  of  Rome  alone,  but  likewis(
strange  events  of  the  universal  world  :  I  borrowed  thei
style  and  form."  i  Reflecting  that  '*  our  old  Florentine:
had  left  few  and  confused  records  of  past  deeds  in  our  cir
of  Florence,^  and  that  our  city,  the  child  and  creature  o
Rome,  was  on  the  upward  path,  and  about  to  achieve  grea
things,  whereas  Rome  was  on  the  decline,"  I  resolved  "  t<
bring  into  this  volume  and  new  chronicle  all  the  event
and  beginnings  of  the  city  of  Florence,  .  .  .  and  giv
henceforth  in  full  the  deeds  of  the  Florentines,  and  briefly
the  notable  affairs  of  the  rest  of  the  universe."  3  Thus
according  to  Villani,  the  course  to  be  pursued  was  to  con
nect  the  history  of  Florence  with  that  of  the  world,  a
others  had  done  before  him,  but  in  such  wise  that  Florenc
should  not  be  the  loser,  but  rather  play  the  chief  part
Hence  his  work  is  no  longer  a  mechanical  mosaic  ;  h
arranges  his  history,  dividing  it  in  books  and  chapters
after  the  manner  of  the  ancients.  We  do  not  know  al
the  authorities  from  whom  his  work  was  derived,  for  thi

VILLANI.  51

question  has  not  yet  been  completely  investigated.  But
we  know  that  they  were  many  in  number.  For  general
history,  Martin  Polono  was  still  the  main  source  ;  but
Villani  also  drew  from  the  "  Gesta  Imperatorum  et  Ponti-
ficum  "  of  Thomas  Tuscus,i  the  **  Vita  di  San  Giovanni
Gualberto,"  the  "  Cronache  di  San  Dionigi  "  (an  Italian
translation  of  which  was  printed — 1476  —  before  the
original  text),  and  the"Librodel  Conquisto  d'Oltremare,"
v/hich  was  a  history  of  the  Crusades,  translated  from  the
French  into  almost  every  other  language  during  the
Middle  Ages.  2

That  Villani  is  a  very  valuable  authority  in  Florentine
history  dating  from  the  end  of  the  thirteenth  century,  is
a  fact  well  known  to  all,  and  need  not  be  discussed  here.
As  to  the  origin  of  the  city,  he  has  little  that  is  genuinely
historical  to  tell  us.  His  accounts  begin,  as  usual,  from
1080,  are  more  or  less  identical  with  those  disseminated  by
other  writers,  not  unfrequently  charged  with  the  same
blunders,  and  often  in  the  same  words.  This  singular
resemblance  between  many  of  the  Florentine  chroniclers
when  treating  of  early  times,  and  remarked  upon  later,
was  easily  explained  so  long  as  it  was  taken  for  granted
that  some  chroniclers  had  copied  from  others.  But  when
it  could  be  proved,  as  was  often  the  case,  that  the  same
resemblance  existed  even  between  totally  independent
writers,  the  problem  was  not  so  readily  solved.  For
this  reason.  Prof.  SchefFer-Boichorst,  in  noting  the  fact,
after  impartial  and  keen  investigation,  suggested  the  theory
that  all  the  different  chroniclers  had  drawn  from  some

tremer  (Receuil  des  historians  des  Croisades),''  translated  into  Latin,
Greek,  German,  Spanish,  Italian.  For  the  sources  consulted  by  Villani,
vide  Busson,  "Die  florentinische  Geschichte  der  Malespini"  (Innsbriick,
1869),  and  Scheffer-Boichorst,  **  Die  Geschichte  Malespini,  eine  Fal-

common  source,  of  which  nothing  was  now  known.  See-
ing that  Tolomeo  of  Lucca,  whose  Annals  were  already
concluded  before  Villani  began  to  colour  his  design,  often
quotes  from  "Gesta"  and  *'Acta  Florentinorum,"  *'Gesta"
and  "  Acta  Lucensium,"  the  German  critic  assigned  the
name  of  "Gesta  Florentinum"  to  what,  in  his  opinion,  musl
have  been  the  original  source  used  by  all  the  chroniclen
of  Florence  down  to  the  beginning  of  the  fourteenth  cen-
tury. This  hypothesis  became  generally  accepted  as  tht
most  probable  explanation  of  a  fact  that  was  otherwise
inexplicable.  But  when  attempts  were  made  to  precisel)
define  the  nature  and  limits  of  the  "  Gesta  " — to  define
not  only  its  language,  but  in  which  year  it  was  begun
in  which  ended,  together  with  the  style  and  exact  charactei
both  of  the  work  and  its  author — the  question  then  stooc
on  very  disputable  ground.  Accordingly,  I  will  leave
discussions  of  this  kind  on  one  side,  as  beyond  the  sphen
of  a  general  outline.  Besides,  I  must  agree  with  Prof
C.  Paoli  I  in  considering  that  the  '*  Gesta "  cannot  hav(
been  a  strictly  individual  work,  but  rather  a  collection  o:
Florentine  news,  originally  of  very  meagre  proportions
but  gradually  enriched  by  fresh  annalistic  matter  and  nev
additions,  as  it  passed  from  hand  to  hand.  Some  com-
pilation of  this  kind,  but  of  greater  weight  and  reput(
(now  unluckily  perished),  must  have  fallen  into  the  hand:
of  various  chroniclers,  who  made  use  of  it  in  turn,  uncon
scious  that  it  had  served  others  before  them.  And  thes(
chroniclers  were  again  copied  by  several  of  a  later  period.
Villani  begins  with  the  Tower  of  Babel  and  the  confu
sion  of  tongues  and  then  passes  on  to  the  legendary  origir
of  Florence,  dividing  it  in  chapters  and  expounding  it  a
though  it  were  genuine  history,  but  inserting  variou
alterations,  to  which  we  shall  refer  later  on.  He  thei

VILLANFS  HISTORY.  53

from  the  year  1080  engrafts  on  this  stock  all  the  accounts
of  Florence  he  had  been  able  to  collect,  and  even  colours
these  by  a  variety  of  other  legends  much  diffused  among
the  people  at  the  time,  and  often,  also,  by  the  addition  of
fantastic  considerations  of  his  own.  What  amount  of
accurate  knowledge  can  be  derived  from  all  this  ?  Sub-
stantially we  find  a  single  legend,  and  a  small  number  of
historical  facts  of  undoubted  value,  though  not  free  from
errors,  floating,  as  elsewhere,  in  an  ocean  of  events  quite
unconnected  with  Florence,  intermixed  with  scraps  of
misty  traditions  or  legends,  arbitrarily  interpreted  and
explained.  Therefore,  the  first  question  to  be  decided  is
that  of  the  origin  and  value  of  the  legend  itself.  Can  a!iy
historical  information  be  derived  from  it,  either  directly  or
indirectly .?  The  second  question  is  :  Can  it  be  ascertained
with  any  certainty  what  original  nucleus  of  authentic
information  the  "  Gesta  Florentinorum  "  must  have  con-
tained ^  The  latter  at  least  presents  no  serious  difficulty,
seeing  that  when  we  compare  the  various  chroniclers,
particularly  those  who  worked  independently,  and  extract
what  Florentine  material  they  used  in  common  and  often
gave  in  the  same  words,  the  main  point  is  won.  But,
after  all  this,  and  after  trying  to  extract  some  substance
(scant  enough,  as  will  be  seen)  from  the  legend,  very  little
genuine  information  is  gained.  It  is  therefore  an  absolute
necessity  to  seek  the  aid  of  all  public  and  private  docu-
ments contained  in  our  Archives,  and  of  all  learned
modern  investigations  regarding  medieval  history  in
general,  and  that  of  Florence  in  particular.  Florentine
historical  research,  first  inaugurated  by  Ammirato,  was
diligently  pursued  in  the  eighteenth  century  by  Borghini,
Lami,  and  numerous  other  scholars,  down  to  the  present
day.  Nevertheless,  the  definite  results  of  these  pro-
longed inquiries,  this  vast  display  of  learning,  were  still
very  few.     For  instance,  we  find  that  even  the  illustrious


54  THE  ORIGIN  OF  FLORENCE.

Gino  Capponi,  after  a  short  introduction  to  his  History
of  Florence,  is  compelled,  like  the  ancients,  to  leap  to  the
death  of  Countess  Matilda,  and  makes  his  first  mention,
so  to  say,  of  the  Commune  after  it  had  already  existed  for
some  time.  Then  the  history  of  almost  two  centuries,
to  the  year  121 5,  or  thereabouts,  is  summed  up  in  twelve
pages,  and  only  from  the  thirteenth  forward  are  events
related  really  in  full.

But  in  these  days  the  study  of  mediaeval  documents
has  made  extraordinary  progress,  above  all  in  Germany,
and  accordingly  the  Florentine  question  has  been  again
reopened.     Dr.   O.   Hartwig  was  the  first  to  apply  his
learning  to  the  task,  employing  the  scientific  method.  He
not  only  examined  all  that  was  published  on  the  subject,
but  made  fresh  researches  in  Italian  libraries  and  archives,
further  aided  by  precious  notes  of  documents  newly  dis-
covered in  Tuscany  by   D.  Wiistenfeld.     Thus,   in    the
work  from   which  we   have   frequently   quoted,   he  was
enabled  to  give  a  collection  of  valuable  documents  and
of  learned  dissertations  which  have  been  already  turned
to  account,  will  serve   as  a  basis  for  future  researches,
and  would   be  still  better  known  and  appreciated  wen
they  penned  in  a  more   popular  style.      Much  has  beer
found,   very  much    read    by    Prof.    Perrens,    who    ha;
devoted  his   life  to  Florentine  history,  and  already  pub-
lished eight  volumes  of  his  work.     His  first  volume,  o
five  hundred  pages,  only  extends  to  the  middle  of  the
thirteenth  century,  and  therefore  treats  of  the  origin  o:
the  city  learnedly  and  at  length.     All  Italians  owe  hin
gratitude  for  this  ;    but  it    must  be   confessed   that    hi;
untiring  zeal,  vast  learning,  and  prodigious  reading  hav(
not  always  resulted  in  a  due  amount  of  historical  accuracy
and  sureness  of  method.     Treating  of  a  period  in  whicl
all  has  to  be  built  up  on  a  very  scanty  number  of  knowi
factSj,  unless  these  facts  are  thoroughly  ascertained  di?

PROF.  PERRENS'  HISTORY.  55

astrous  consequences  are  apt  to  ensue.  For  example,  in
investigating  the  first  origin  of  the  Consuls,  he  still  relies
on  the  document  of  Pogna,  dated  March  4,  iioi,  in
which  they  are  named,  and  without  remarking  that
Capponi,  from  whom,  nevertheless,  he  continually  quotes,
had  proved  that,  although  long  thought  correct,  this  date
was  erroneous,  and  should  be  altered  to  March  4,  1181,
Florentine  style,  the  which  signifies  11 82  in  the  modern
style.  Thus  Prof.  Perrens  introduces  Consuls  long
before  they  were  born.i  Elsewhere  he  plunges  into  the
very  intricate  dispute  as  to  the  jurisdiction  exercised  over
their  own  territory  by  the  Florentines  of  the  twelfth
century.  He  repeats  with  the  old  chroniclers  that  in
1 1 86  Frederic  I.  deprived  them  of  all  jurisdiction  beyond
the  city  walls,  but  that  they  re-acquired  it  in  11 88.  He
adds  that  on  the  Emperor  Frederic's  decease  in  1 190,  his
successor,  Henry  VI.  "  comme  don  de  joyeux  evenement,
multiplie  les  privileges."  He  fails  to  reflect  that  the
patent  quoted  in  support  of  the  latter  assertion  bears  the
date  of  1 187,  and  that  he  gives  the  date  in  a  note  of  his
own. 2  How  is  the  reader  to  disentangle  this  skein?  As
another  example,  we  may  add  that  the  author  gives  as  an
historical  fact  the  legendary  tale  of  the  origin  of  the
Colombina  festival  held  on  Holy  Saturday.  The  Floren-
tines are  sent  to  the  Crusades  by  their  archbishop,  Ranieri,
in  1099  :  that  is  several  centuries  before  Florence  possessed
an  archbishop.  Pazzino  de  Pazzi,  in  reward  for  his
feats  of  valour  at  the  taking  of  Jerusalem,  receives  the
mural  crown  from  Godfrey  de  Bouillon,  together  with
the  right  to  change  his  arms  and  adopt  the  crosses  and
dolphins,  the  which  change  was  only  effected  by  the  Pazzi

'  "  II  y  en  eut  (des  consuls)  tout  au  moins  eniioi.''  And  after  quoting
the  document  he  adds  this  note  : — "  Devant  de  fait  si  positif,  il  serait
oiseux  de  S'arreter  aux  conjectures  des  auteurs  meme  presque  contem-
porains,"  p.  209.

several  centuries  later. ^  Pazzino  returns  to  Florence  in
triumph,  mounted  on  a  car,  of  which  the  description  is
given  ;  and  at  a  time  when  the  Commune  was  not  yet
established,^  is  received  in  the  style  of  a  Roman  conqueror
by  the  people,  the  clergy,  and  the  magistrates.  He  has
brought  three  stones  from  the  Holy  Sepulchre,  and  these
are  the  flints  from  which  the  sparks  are  still  struck  to  fire
the  Car  of  the  Dove.  All  this  is  derived  from  Gamurrini's
"  Storia  genealogica,"  an  utterly  valueless  work.3  Readers
may  consider  it  strangely  invidious  on  my  part  to  be  at
the  pains  to  refer  to  certain  blunders  contained  in  a  work
of  which  I  am  the  first  to  recognise  the  merits,  and  by
which  I  have  often  profited.  But  it  seemed  necessary  to
explain  why,  in  spite  of  having  praised,  I  should  so  sel-
dom quote  it.  The  work  undeniably  comprises  abundant
historic  material,  is  written  with  vivacity  and  clearness,
contains  many  keen  observations,  and  does  honour  to  an
author  to  whom  Italians  are  bound  to  be  grateful.  But
although  for  all  these  reasons  it  is  a  book  deserving
attention,  no  possible  use  can  be  made  of  it,  without
continually  verifying  the  authorities  cited  in  it.

Here  a  word  must  be  said  touching  another  and  far
less  imposing  work,  to  which  we  have  been  able  to  re-
fer with  far  greater  security.  Already,  in  certain  short
papers  appearing  in  the  "Archivio  Storico  Italiano,"  Prof.
Santini  had  proved  his  power  of  keen  research  on  the  early
history  of  Florence,  and  has  now  had  the  happy  idea  of
collecting  all  the  documents  on  the  subject,  both  published

S8  THE  ORIGIN  OF  FLORENCE.

quickly  leaving  him  aside,  strides  on  to  the  foundation  of
Fiesole  by  Atlas  and  his  spouse,  aided  by  the  counsels  ot
Apollonius  the  astrologer.  Fiesole  was  the  first  city  built ;
it  was  erected  on  the  healthiest  spot  in  Europe,  and
hence  its  name — Fie  sola.  The  children  of  Atlas  spread
over  the  land  and  populated  it.  The  eldest  son  was
called  Italo,  and  gave  Italy  its  name ;  the  third  was
Sicano,  who  conquered  and  named  Sicily.  The  second
son,  Dardano,  wandered  farther  a-field,  and  founded  the
city  of  Troy.  I  The  legend  next  passes  rapidly  to  the
Trojan  war,  the  flight  of  ^Eneas,  and  the  foundation  of
Rome,  of  which  city  Florence  is  the  favourite  offspring.
It  then  goes  on  to  speak  at  much  greater  length,  of
Catiline,  regarding  whom  so  many  particulars  are  given,
that  he  must  have  been  the  subject  of  a  separate  legend
which  either,  when  united  with  the  rest,  at  z.  later  date,
formed  the  so-called  "  Chronica  de  origine  Civitatis,"  or
was,  more  probably,  anterior  to  this,  and  only  amalgamated
with  it  in  subsequent  compilations.

After  conspiring  against  Rome  Catiline  came  to  Fiesole,
whither  the  Romans  pursued  and  attacked  him,  under
their  consuls  Metellus  and  Fiorinus.  The  latter  falling
in  battle,  their  army  was  totally  defeated  on  the  banks
of  the  Arno.  But  Julius  Cassar  came  to  avenge  them,
besieged  and  destroyed  Fiesole  ;  and  then,  on  the  same
spot  where  Fiorinus  had  fallen,  a  new  city  was  built,  and
called  Fiorenza  to  commemorate  his  name.  Catiline  fled
to  the  Pistoiian  Appennines,  but  was  pursued  there  and

•  Servius  writes,  in  his  Commentary  on  the  ^nead  (bk.  iii.  v.  104) :
"Dardanus  lovis  filius  et  Electrae,  profectus  de  Corytho  [Cortona],
civitate  Tusciae,  primus  venit  ad  Troyam."  And  farther  on  (Com.,
bk.  iii.  V.  187),  he  says  that  "  Dardanus  et  lasius  fratres  .  .  .  cum  ex
Etruria  proposuissent  sedes  exteras  petere  ecc."  In  tracing  the  genealogy
of  /Eneas,  he  begins  thus  :  "  Ex  Electra  Atalantis  filia  et  love  Dardanus
nascitur."  This  must  have  partly  inspired  the  legend,  although,  accord-
ing to  the  latter,  Electra  is  the  wife  of  Atlas  and  the  daughter  of  Jove.

routed.  So  great  was  the  number  of  the  killed,  that  a
pestilence  broke  out,  and  from  this  Pistoia  derived  its
name.  I

In  the  legend  the  nomenclature  of  Tuscan  cities  is
always  explained  on  the  same  principles,  Pisa,  for  instance,
being  derived  from  pesare  (to  weigh).  For  the  Romans
received  their  tributes  there,  and  these  were  so  numerous
that  they  had  to  be  weighed  in  two  different  places.  This
is  why  they  spoke  of  the  city  in  the  plural,  Pisae  Pisarum.
Lucca  comes  from  lucere  (to  shine),  because  it  was  the
first  city  converted  to  the  light  of  Christianity.  When
the  Franks  2  marched  against  the  Longobards  in  the  South
they  halted  at  a  place  in  central  Italy,  and  left  all  their

'  Even  Brunette  Latini,  in  bk.  i.  of  his  "  Tesoro,"  makes  the  Catiline
legend  relate  to  the  origin  of  Florence,  records  the  great  slaughter
occurring  at  the  battle  wherein  Catiline  was  routed,  and  also  the  sub-
sequent pestilence.  "  E  per  quella  grande  peste  di  quella  grande
uccisione,  fu  appellata  la  cittk  di  Pistoia  (bk.  i.  chap.  37,  in  the  vulgate
of  Bono  Giamboni).  The  principal  authorities  for  the  historical  in-
formation in  the  "Tesoro"  are  Dictys  of  Crete,  and  the  "De  excidio
Troie,"  attributed  to  Dares  the  Phrygian.  Undoubtedly  the  latter  is
also  one  of  the  sources  of  our  legend.  Vide  Thor  Sundy,  "  Delia  vita
e  delle  opere  di  Brunetto  Latini,"  translated,  with  many  additions,  by
Prof.  R.  Renier.     Florence  :  Le  Monnier,  1884.

'  The  "  Libro  flesolano  "  styles  them  Africans  instead  of  Franks,  una
compagnia  venttta  d Africa,  as  elsewhere,  instead  of  Ottone  or  Otto,  it
says  Ceto,  a  blunder  also  found  in  the  MS.  that  was  printed.  The
blunders  probably  originated  from  some  ignorant  copyist  of  the  legend,
and  were  frequently  repeated  by  later  scribes.  John  of  Salisbury
("  Polikratikus,"  vi.  17,  edit.  Giles),  in  mentioning  the  cities  built  by
Brennus,  according  to  history,  repeats  the  same  story  of  Siena  contained
in  the  legend.  He  remarks  that  all  this  is  not  real  history,  sed  Celebris
traditio  est,  adding,  however,  that  tradition  is  confirmed  by  the  fact  that
in  their  constitution,  beauty  and  customs,  the  Sienese  resemble  ''  ad
gallos  et  Britones  a  quibus  originem  contraxerunt."  John  of  Salisbury's
words  are  also  recorded  by  Benvenuto  da  Imola  in  his  Commentary  on
the  "  Divina  Commedia,"  where  he  mentions  that  Dante  intended  to
allude  to  this  resemblance  ("  Inferno,"  xxix.  121)  in  the  lines  :

"  Or  fu  giammai
Gente  si  vana  come  la  senese  ?
Certo  non  la  francesca  si  d'assai."

,Boccaccio's  "  Commento  "  gives  the  sanxe  explanation  of  these  lines.

aged  people  behind  them.  Thus  the  city  built  on  that
site  received  the  name,  likewise  in  the  plural,  of  Senae
Senarum.  Florence,  however,  according  to  the  legend,
derived  its  name  from  Fiorinus,  although  later  writers
declared  it  to  be  taken  from  the  word  Fluentia^  because
it  stood  by  the  river  Arno  ;  others,  again,  from  the
numerous  flowers  springing  from  its  soil.  It  was  built
in  the  likeness  of  Rome,  with  a  capitol,  forum,  theatre,  and
baths,  and  was  consequently  called  Little  Rome.  Its
friends  are  always  the  friends  of  Rome  ;  the  foes  of  the
one  are  foes  of  the  other.

After  five  hundred  years,  so  runs  the  legend,  Totila
Jlagellum  Dei  came  and  destroyed  Florence,  and  im-
mediately rebuilt  the  rival  city  of  Fiesole.  This  clearly
alludes  to  Attila,  since  he  bore  the  title  o^flagellum  Dei^  and
in  the  Middle  Ages  was  the  real  type  of  the  devastator  and
destroyer  of  cities.  As  he  never  came  to  Florence  he
was  converted  into  Totila,  who  had  been  there,  although
never  designated  by  the  same  appellation.  This  exchange
of  names  was  aided  by  their  resemblance,  nor  is  it  the
sole  example  the  Middle  Ages  afford  of  the  confusion  of
Attila  with  Totila.  In  the  "  Divina  Commedia  "  ("  In-
ferno," xiii.  148-9)  we  find  Dante  attributing  the  destruc-
tion of  Florence  to  Attila,  when  he  says  :

"  Quei  cittadin  che  poi  la  rifondarno
Sovra  il  cener  che  d'Attila  rimase.''

And  hereby  he  doubly  deserts  the  legend ;  for,  according
to  that,  Florence  was  rebuilt  by  the  Romans  and  then,
naturally,  on  the  pattern  of  Christian  Rome,  with
churches  dedicated  to  St.  Peter,  St.  John,  St.  Laurence,
&c.,  as  in  the  Eternal  City.

Thereupon   more  than   500   years '  elapsed  in  peace  ;

'  The  Latin  compilation  says  :  quingentos  annos  et  plus ;  the  Italian,
and  more  modern  versions,  merely  say,  "  five  hundred  years."


DESTRUCTION  OF  FIESOLE.  6i

but  then  Florence,  finally  resolving  to  be  revenged  on  its
perpetual  rival,  suddenly  attacked  and  destroyed  Fiesole.
At  this  point  we  may  remark  that,  if  Florence  had  been
first  founded  in  Caesar's  time,  and  adorned  with  Roman
monuments  at  a  later  date ;  if,  after  500  years, ^  it  was
destroyed  by  Totila,  and  then  itself  overthrew  Fiesole
after  another  interval  of  500  years,  the  chronology  of  the
legend  clearly  brings  us  to  the  eleventh  century  at  least.
If  we  also  add  that  the  assault  and  partial  destruction  of
Fiesole  really  occurred  in  11 25,  it  follows  that,  as  we
have  noted,  the  legend  cannot  have  been  framed  before
the  twelfth  century.

Here,  then,  it  should  end  and  give  place  to  history.  In
fact,  Sanzanome,  the  earliest  of  the  chroniclers,  begins  his
work  with  the  destruction  of  Fiesole.  But  the  "  Libro
fiesolano "  sometimes  introduces  capricious  turns  in  the
framework  of  the  legend,  and  at  this  point  makes  an
addition  worthy  of  note  as  an  evidence  of  the  mode
in  which  these  fantastic  stories  were  built  up.  The
added  portion  refers  to  the  Uberti,  powerful  citizens
always  opposed  to  popular  government  in  Florence.
According  to  tradition,  they  came  originally  from  Ger-
many with  the  Othos.  Evidently,  however,  this  theory
was  repugnant  to  the  author  of  the  "  Libro  fiesolano,"
possibly  an  adherent  of  the  Uberti,  and  he  therefore
remarks,  with  some  heat,  that,  on  the  contrary,  the
Uberti  were  descended  from  Catiline,  "  most  noble  king
of  Rome,"  with  Trojan  blood  running  in  his  veins.
Catiline's  son  Uberto  Cesare  had  a  Fiesolan  wife,  who
bore  him  sixteen  children;  and  he  was  afterwards  sent  by
Augustus  to  reconquer  Saxony,  which  had  risen  in  rebellion.
While  in  that  country  Uberto  Catilina  married  a  German
lady  of  high  position,  and  from  this  union  sprang  "  the

'  Even  history  tells  us  that  Totila  was  in  Tuscany  towards  the  middle
of  the  sixth  century.


62  THE  ORIGIN  OF  FLORENCE.

lineage  of  the  good  Ceto  [Otho]  of  Sansognia."  Thus  it
is  false  that  the  Uberti  were  "  born  of  the  Emperor  of
Germany,  the  truth  being  that  the  emperor  was  born  of
their  race."  ^  This  addition,  posterior  to  the  rest  of  the
legend,  shows  that  the  author  desired  to  exalt  the  Uberti  ;
but,  remembering  their  constant  hostility  to  the  Florentine
government,  declared  them  descended  from  Catiline  and
his  Fiesolan  bride.  Also,  being  unable  to  deny  outright
their  Ghibelline  proclivities  and  Germanic  origin,  yet
unwilling  to  acknowledge  their  descent  from  the  Othos,
he  converts  them  into  the  latter's  progenitors.  Thus  the
legend  is  brought  into  harmony  with  its  compiler's  views,
or  rather,  with  his  intent  of  magnifying  his  friends.

Inquiry  into  the  sources  of  this  legend  would  only
lead  us  astray,  without  throwing  any  new  light  on  the
origin  of  Florence,  since  the  fable  has  no  real  historical
value.  We  need  only  say  that,  besides  Darses'  "  De
excidio  Troiae,"  the  commentary  to  Virgil  of  Servius  ;
Orosio's  History,  Paolo  Diacono's  Roman  History,  and
the  "  Storia  Miscella,"  &c.,  must  have  been  consulted  for
Jts  compilation. 2  Leaving  the  question  aside,  we  may
rather  note  that,  although  Villani  and  Malespini  both
give  the  legend  as  a  preface  to  their  histories,  they  not
only  refer  to  two  separate  compilations,  but  use  them  in  a
totally  different  way.3  This  is  another  proof  that  even  if
Malespini's  chronicle  were  copied  from  Villani,  it  is  not
always  an  exact  reproduction.  He  refers  to  the  *'  Libro
fiesolano,"  4  but  enlarges  it  with  two  entire  chapters  of
his  own,  containing  a  complete  story,  probably  derived
from  some  episode  of  the  Catiline  legend.     And  although

THE  CATILINE  LEGEND.  63

teeming   with  the   strangest    anachronisms,    it   is    better
written  and  far  livelier  than  the  rest.

In  this  tale  we  find  Fiorino  converted  into  a  Roman
king,  married  to  the  most  beautiful  woman  ever  seen,
appropriately  named  Belisca.  After  the  defeat  and  death
of  her  husband,  Queen  Belisca  remained  the  captive  of  a
wicked  knight  named  Pravus,  but  Catiline  causes  him  to
be  put  to  death,  and  carries  off  Belisca,  of  whom  he  is
desperately  enamoured.  The  queen,  however,  is  in
despair  concerning  the  fate  of  her  lovely  daughter
Teverina,  imprisoned  in  the  house  of  one  Centurione,  and
adored  by  him.  In  kissing  Teverina's  beautiful  hair  this
man  had  exclaimed  :  "It  is  these  that  enchain  me,  for
lovelier  locks  have  I  never  seen."  On  the  day  of
Pentecost  the  mother  attended  mass  in  the  Fiesole
church,  and  with  bitter  tears  bemoaned  the  loss  of  her
child.  Her  prayer  was  heard  by  a  serving-maid,  who
knew  where  Teverina  was  hidden,  and  revealed  it  to  the
weeping  mother.  On  receiving  the  news,  Catiline
instantly  attacked  Centurione's  palace,  and,  after  a  fierce
struggle,  succeeded  in  capturing  him.  The  prisoner  owed
his  life  to  Belisca's  intercession  ;  for,  having  regained  her
child,  she  desired  to  save  him,  dressed  his  wounds,  and
urged  him  to  fly  from  Catiline's  wrath.  Centurione
consented  to  escape,  and  having  mounted  his  horse,
implored  permission  to  bid  a  last  farewell  to  Teverina.
But  when  she  appeared,  he  caught  her  in  his  arms,  and
galloped  away,  followed  by  his  men.  The  mother
fainted  from  grief,  and  Catiline,  *'  with  all  his  barons,"
a  thousand  horse  and  two  thousand  foot,  pursued  the
traitor  to  the  castle  of  Naldo,  ten  miles  off,  and  pro-
ceeded to  attack  him  there.  But  at  that  moment  news
came  that  the  Romans  were  marching  on  Fiesole,  so  he
was  obliged  to  hasten  back  there  before  the  siege  should
begin.     Thus  ends  the  singular  episode  annexed  to  the

legend,    when,    having    lost    its    primitive    character,    it
became  a  fairy  tale  while  pretending  to  be  history.

Villani,  on  the  other  hand,  follows  a  more  ancient
compilation,  and  rejects  the  Belisca  story.  He,  too,  is
acquainted  with  the  "  Libro  fiesolano,"  makes  some  use
of  it,  but  considers  it  unauthentic  exactly  at  the  point
where  we  find  Malespini  adhering  to  it.  In  fact,  when
recording  the  pretended  descent  of  the  Uberti  from  Cati-
line, Villani  adds  :  "  We  find  no  proof  of  these  matters
in  any  authentic  history."  i  Also,  in  trying,  as  far  as
possible,  to  give  the  legend  a  more  genuine  and  historical
appearance,  he  often  inserts  alterations  drawn  from  the
sources  on  which  the  legend  itself  was  based,  sometimes
quoting  Roman  poets  and  historians  such  as  Ovid,  Lucan,
Titus  Livy,  and,  above  all,  SaJlust,  to  whom  he  refers
when  adding  certain  historical  particulars  to  the  Catiline
legends.  A  permanently  instructive  psychological  fact  is
afforded  us  by  the  men  of  this  period,  and  most  of  all  by
Villani.  How  was  it  that  a  contemporary  of  Dante — a
man  practised  in  affairs,  cultivated,  intellectual,  and  acutely
observant — could  mingle  so  much  and  such  puerile  credu-
lity with  great  intelligence,  culture,  and  common  sense .?

In  short,  v/hat  substantial  information  can  be  gleaned
from  the  "  Chronica  de  origine  civitatis  "  .f*  Besides
the  ambitious  aim,  common  to  nearly  all  the  cities  of
Italy,  of  trying  to  trace  their  origin  back  to  the  Romans
and  Trojans,  the  "  Chronica  "  wishes  to  impress  upon  us
that  the  Etruscan  Fiesole  was  the  constant  rival  of  Roman
Florence,  which  could  not  prosper  until  the  former  was
destroyed.  Therefore,  Catiline,  the  enemy  of  Rome,  is
the  defender  of  Fiesole,  Cassar,  Augustus,  the  emperors,
are  the  founders,  champions,  and  restorers  of  Florence,
which  is  always  described  as  being  in  the  likeness  of  Rome
and  styled  little  Rome,  Augusta,  Cesarea,  &c.     Totila  or

'  Villani,  i.  41.


THE  BIRTH  OF  FLORENCE.  65

Attila — that  is,  barbarians  who  overthrew  the  Empire — are
likewise  destroyers  of  Florence.  Another  legend  of  later
date  attributes  the  rebuilding  of  the  city  to  Charlemagne,
the  restorer  of  the  Empire.  So  at  least  the  tale  runs  in
Villani  and  Malespini  ;  but  there  is  no  trace  of  it  either
in  the  *'  De  Origine,"  or  the  "  Libro  fiesolano,"  both
impregnated  with  Roman  traditions  only,  and  the
legends  of  chivalry  being  as  yet  unknown  to  Florence.
In  fact,  Villani  remarks,  when  repeating  the  tale  :  "  We
find  (it)  in  the  '  Chronicles  of  France.'  "  '

We  may  accept  as  a  certainty  that  the  first  origin  of
Florence  was  owed  to  Etruscan  Fiesole,  and  that  this  was
known  even  in  the  days  of  Dante  is  proved  by  his  lines
to  the  Florentines  ('*  Inferno,"  xv.  61-3)  :

•*  Ma  quell'  ingrato  popolo  maligno,
Che  discese  da  Fiesole  ab  antico,
E  tiene  ancor  del  monte  e  del  macigno."

And  Niccolo  Machiavelli,  leaving  all  legends  aside  (as
Aretino  had  done  before  him),  justly  declared  that  the
traders  of  Fiesole  had  begun  from  very  remote  times  to
form  a  commercial  settlement  on  the  Arno,  at  the  point
where  the  Mugnone  runs  into  the  river.  So  gradually
a  cluster  of  cabins  arose,  grew  into  houses,  and  finally
became  a  rival  city.  But  the  city  was  entirely  constructed
by  the  Romans,  though  at  what  precise  period  is  still  un-
ascertained. It  is  scarcely  probable  that  the  event  can
have  occurred  earlier  than  two  centuries  before  Christ.
Perhaps  the  city  began  to  rise  when,  to  protect  Tuscany
against  Ligurian  invaders,  the  Romans  made  a  network  of
roads  through  the  valley  of  the  Arno  ;  that  is,  when

the  first  to  mention  it.  But  in  the  second  century  of  the
Vulgar  Era  Florius  already  styles  it  Municipium  splendi-
dissmum,  and  records  it  among  the  cities  which  suffered
most  in  the  days  of  Sulla. ^  Recent  excavations  made  in
digging  new  sewers  under  Florence  have  furnished  proofs
that  in  Sulla's  time  the  city  must  have  already  possessed
buildings  of  no  small  importance,  including  an  amphi-
theatre.2  The  restoration  of  Florence,  after  the  serious
injuries  inflicted  on  it  in  Sulla's  day,  is  generally  attributed
to  Augustus,  who  is  supposed  to  have  made  it  the  seat  of
one  of  the  twenty-eight  colonies  founded  by  him,  whence
the  name  Julia^  Augusta^  Florentia.  The  "  Liber  Colo-
niarum  "  (p.  213,  6)  numbers  Florence  among  the  colonies
formed  by  the  Triumviri  (45  B.C.),  and  it  certainly  must

Ital.,"  Series  iii.,  vol.  ii.  p.  62  and  fol.  Hartwig,  op.  cit.,  and  Milani,
"  Scavi  di  Mercato  Vecchio,"  in  the  "  Notizie  degli  scavi  nel  mesa  d'
Aprile,  1887,  Atti  dell'  Accademia  dei  Lincei."

'  In  digging  a  sewer  in  the  street  called  Borgo  dei  Greci,  in  1886,
the  discovery  was  made  in  Professor  Milani's  presence,  "at  the  depth
of  about  three  metres  beneath  the  street  level,  and  exactly  beneath  the
pavement  of  the  first  circuit  of  the  Amphitheatre,  ...  of  a  half  asse
onciale,  weighing  12  grammes  25,  undoubtedly  coeval  with  the  construc-
tion of  the  Florentine  Amphitheatre.  This  kind  of  coin  assuredly
dates  from  89  B.C.,  and  was  issued  after  the  Plautian-Papirian  decree
reducing  the  weight  of  the  aes  from  i  oz.  to  ^  oz.  The  aes  cut  with  a
chisel  were  only  in  currency  for  a  short  time,  and  were  withdrawn  when
the  new  coins  were  issued.  Accordingly  they  must  have  ceased  by  the
date  of  the  second  triumvirate  (43  B.C.),  when  the  aes  was  further  reduced
to  the  third  of  an  ounce.  We  may  therefore  accept  the  conclusion  that
the  Florence  Amphitheatre  was  of  the  SuUian  period.  Opposed  to  this
conclusion  is  the  fact  that,  according  to  the  report  of  Dione  (li.  23),  the
first  stone  amphitheatre  built  in  Rome  was  that  of  Taurus,  dating  from
anno  30  B.C.  But  recalling  how  Cicero  accused  Sulla  of  having  wasted
treasures  on  magnificent  buildings,  exactly  when  he  was  under  Fiesole,
one  is  justified  in  assigning  the  construction  of  the  Florence  amphitheatre,
and  also  of  that  of  Pompei,  to  Sulla's  day.  Likewise  the  basements  of
the  Tuscanic  columns,  found  in  situ  near  the  Amphitheatre,  and  some
architectural  fragments  discovered  in  1887  on  the  south  side  of  Santa
Maria  del  Fiore,  confirmed  the  opinion  that  some  of  the  chief  public
buildings  of  Florence  were  connected  with  the  times  of  Sulla  and  also
with  the  last  days  of  the  Republic."  (From  a  letter  by  Prof.  Milani
addressed  to  myself.)

ROMAN  FLORENCE.  67

have  been  a  colony  in  15  B.C.,  when  the  city  sent  a  depu-
tation to  Tiberius  asking  him  to  forbid  the  junction  of
the  river  Chiana  with  the  Arno,  on  account  of  the  damage
this  would  cause  (Tacitus,  *'Ann.,"  i.  79).  But  the
weighty  authority  of  Mommsen  supports  the  view  that,
in  spite  of  the  testimony  given  by  Florius,  the  colony
of  Florence  was  founded  instead  by  Sulla,  ^  The  same
date  may  be  assigned  to  the  construction  of  the  oldest
circuit  of  walls,  existing  during  a  great  part  of  the
Middle  Ages,  and  some  remains  of  which  have  been  dis-
covered in  our  own  day.

Florence  would  seem  to  have  been  built  in  the  form  of  the
ancient  Roman  C^xj/ra;;;,  a  quadrangle  traversed  by  two  wide
and  perfectly  straight  streets,  crossing  it  in  the  centre  at
right  angles  and  dividing  it  into  quarters.  The  Campi-
doglio  stood  in  the  middle  on  the  site  afterwards  occupied
by  the  Church  of  Santa  Maria  in  Campidoglio,  and  the
Forum  was  near  at  hand,  on  the  site  of  the  now  demolished
Mercato  Vecchio.  There  was  also  the  amphitheatre,
known  in  the  Middle  Ages  as  the  Parlascio^  of  which
some  traces  exist  near  Borgo  de'  Greci  ;  a  theatre  (in
Via  de'  Gondi.)  ;  a  temple  of  Isis  (on  the  site  of  San
Firenze)  ;  and  baths  in  the  street  still  known  as  Via
delle  Terme.2  Accordingly,  it  is  not  surprising  that  the
city,  which  was  then  very  small  and  limited  to  this  side  of

'  The  inscription  (now  lost)  beginning  thus  :  •'  Collpnta]  Iul[/a]

Mommsen,  as  referring  to  Vienne  in  Dauphiny.  Vide  "  Hermes,"  1883,
p.  176  and  p.  180,  note  i.  Prof.  Milani  takes  the  same  view  regarding
the  new  and  important  inscription  recently  found  in  the  excavation  of
the  Mercato  Vecchio,  containing  the  following  words  :

68  THE  ORIGIN  OF  FLORENCE.

the  Arno,  should  have  been  called  Little  Rome,  and  sought
to  base  its  origin  on  Roman  traditions.  The  whole
spirit  of  its  monuments  spoke  of  Rome,  and  the  same
spirit  was  echoed  by  the  minds  and  imaginations  of  those
who  invented  the  legend.  Even  now,  after  so  many  cen-
turies, so  many  changes,  we  still  find  remains  of  Roman
buildings,  and  of  so-called  Byzantine  architecture,  but  no
single  trace  of  the  real  Gothic  or  Longobard  style.

Florence  gradually  extended  as  time  went  on,  and
horghi  were  built  outside  the  walls,  the  largest  of  these
suburban  quarters  being  the  Borgo^  connected  with  the  city
proper  by  the  Ponte  Vecchio.  In  the  second  half  of  the
eleventh  century,  and  in  the  year  1078,  if  Villani's  state-
ment be  correct  (iv  8),  new  walls  were  built  to  replace
the  palisades  surrounding  the  Borghi.  Villani  may  be
accepted  as  an  authority,  now  that  he  is  known  to  have
superintended  the  construction  of  the  third  and  last  circuit
of  walls  begun  in  1299  (viii.  1  and  31),  and  now  almost
entirely  destroyed  save  for  a  fragment  here  and  there.

For  a  long  time  after  the  epoch  of  the  barbarian  inva-
sions the  history  of  Florence  is  involved  in  great  obscurity,
and  what  little  information  we  have  on  the  subject  is  either
entirely  legendary  or  jumbled  with  legends.

In  405  Radagasius  led  a  horde  of  Goths,  mixed  with
other  tribes,  into  Tuscany  and  lay  siege  to  Florence.  But
the  walls  held  out  until  the  Roman  general  Stilicho  came
to  the  rescue,  defeated  the  assailants,  and  put  their  leader
to  death.  The  resistance  of  Florence  was  greatly  magni-
fied, and  Stilicho's  victory  attributed  to  a  miracle.  Tradi-
tion added  that  the  battle  having  been  fought  on  the  8th
of  October,  the  Feast  of  Santa  Reparata,  the  Florentines
inaugurated  their  Pallio  races  on  that  day,  and  founded
the  Church  of  Santa  Reparata  ;  but  both  these  events  were
of  later  occurrence.  The  tradition  merely  serves  to  show
how  long  Florence  preserved  the  memory  of  its  narrow
escape  from  destruction.


rOTILA  IN  TUSCANY,  69

Regarding  the  next  century  tliere  is  an  absolute  blank  ;
but  then  comes  the  legend  that  even  Villani  accepts,
relating  how  Totila,  flagellum  Dei,  destroyed  Florence
and  re-built  Fiesole.^  To  this  the  chronicler  appends  a
second  tale  to  the  effect  that  after  the  city  had  remained
thus  devastated  and  ruined  for  350  years,  Charlemagne
summoned  the  Romans  to  join  him  in  rebuilding  the  city  in
the  likeness  of  Rome,  and  that  it  thus  arose  anew,  adorned
with  churches  dedicated,  like  those  of  Rome,  to  San  Pietro,
San  Lorenzo,  Santa  Maria  Maggiore,  &c.,  and  was  also
granted  a  territory  extending  three  miles  beyond  the
walls. 2  Here  one  sees  that  although  the  chronicler  had
already  recorded,  on  the  authority  of  the  "  De  Origine,"
that  Florence  was  rebuilt  immediately  after  its  pretended
destruction  by  Totila,  he  thought  that  date  premature,
seeing  that  Florence  really  remained  for  long  after  in  a
very  desolate  and  obscure  condition,  and  therefore,  to  save
trouble,  he  also  jots  down  the  posterior  legend  attributing
instead  the  reconstruction  of  the  city  to  Charlemagne,  the
saviour  of  the  Empire.

What  germs  of  truth  can  be  gleaned  from  all  this  ?
Totila  really  entered  Tuscany  in  542,  and  sent  part  of  his
host  to  besiege  Florence.  Justin,  the  commander  of  the
Imperial  garrison  there,  then  sought  aid  from  Ravenna  ;
and  when  the  relieving  force  approached  the  city,  Totila
raised  the  siege  and  withdrew  towards  Sienna.  Pursued
by  the  Imperial  troops,  he  succeeded  in  routing  them,  but
instead  of  returning  against  Florence,  directed  his  march
towards  Southern  Italy.  So  at  least  runs  the  account  given
by  Procopius,  and  also  followed  by  modern  writers. 3  The
Goths,  it  is  true,  made  another  descent  later,  easily  mastered
Tuscany  and  Florence,  and  committed  much  cruelty  there,

70  THE  ORIGIN  OF  FLORENCE.

though  without  destroying  the  city.  These  are  the  facts  ;
all  the  rest  was  a  legendary  excrescence  signifying  that  the
Florentines  endured  a  long  period  of  obscurity  and  oppres-
sion, and  only  began  to  emerge  from  it  in  the  time  of  the
Franks.

In  fact,  the  Longobard  occupation  of  Tuscany  took
place  towards  570,  and  we  have  two  centuries  of  utter
darkness.  We  find  mention  of  one  Gudibrandus,  Dux
civitatis  Floreniinorum,  appointed  by  the  conquerors  ;  but
nothing  else  is  known  to  us.  Amid  the  many  calamities
wrought  by  invasion,  war,  and  harsh  tyranny,  not  only
was  the  trade,  to  which  Florence  owed  its  existence,
entirely  ruined,  but  many  families  escaped  from  the  plains
to  safe  places  among  the  hills,  and  a  good  number
accordingly  took  reflige  in  Fiesole,  which  city  profited  as
usual  by  the  ill  fortune  of  Florence.  And  this  to  so  great
an  extent,  that  during  the  latter  half  of  the  eighth  century
we  find  documents  alluding  to  Florence  as  though  it  had
become  a  suburb  of  Fiesole.  ^  But  soon,  beneath  Charle-
magne's rule,  times  of  greater  order  and  tranquillity  were
inaugurated.  Men  began  once  more  to  forsake  the  hills
for  the  valley  ;  Florence  began  to  prosper  at  Fiesole's
expense.  And  as  the  Franks  replaced  the  Longobard
dukes  by  counts,  so  Florence  too  had  its  count,  exercising
jurisdiction  throughout  the  territories  of  the  bishopric  that
had  been  carved  out  of  the  old  Roman  division.  This
was  the  so-called  contado  fiorentino,  stretching  on  the  one
side  to  a  place  called  I  Confini,  near  Prato,  and  thence
towards  Poggio  a  Caiano,  sweeping  round  by  the  Empoli
district,  and  conterminous  with  the  borders  of  Lucca,
Volterra,  and  the  contado  of  Fiesole.^

'  Lami,  "  Lezioni,"  pt  i.  p.  293.  From  a  document  also  quoted  by
Maratori  and  Tiraboschi,  it  would  seem  that  Florence  was  included,
as  it  were,  in  the  city  of  Fiesole ;  and  therefore  some  of  the  Florentine
churches  were  described  as  being  in  Fiesole.  Vide  also  pt.  ii.  p.  429
of  the  same  work.

•  This  is  described  in  detail  by  Lami,  Borghini,  and  Hartwig.


CHARLEMAGNE  IN  FLORENCE.  yi

Charlemagne  halted  in  Florence,  and  celebrated  Christ-
mas there  in  786  ;  he  likewise  defended  the  property  of
the  Florentine  Church  against  Longobard  aggressions.
This  gave  rise  to  the  legend  that  the  rebuilding  of  the  city
was  his  work.  Regardless  of  anachronisms,  Villani  not  only
adds  that  many  imaginary  privileges  were  conceded  by  him,
but  attributes  to  this  period  the  birth  of  the  Commune
which  only  took  place  several  centuries  later,  *'  Charles,"  he
tells  us,  "  created  many  knights,  and  granted  privileges  to
the  city  by  rendering  free  and  independent  the  Commune,
its  inhabitants,  and  the  contado,  with  all  dwellers  therein,
for  three  miles  round,  inclusive  of  resident  strangers  from
other  parts.  For  this  reason  many  men  returned  to  the
said  city,  and  framed  its  government  after  the  Roman
mode,  namely,  with  two  consuls  and  a  council  of  one
hundred  senators."  ^  But  this  addition  is  made  by  the
chronicler,  and  in  a  more  arbitrary  way  than  the  legend

itself.

Nor  was  this  all.  Not  Charlemagne  only,  but  likewise
Otho  I.,  the  regenerator  of  the  German  Empire,  must  be
necessarily  the  patron  of  Florence,  "  because,"  continues
the  chronicler,  "  it  had  always  appertained  to  the  Romans
and  been  faithful  to  the  Empire."  2  In  the  year  g^^  the
emperor  halted  in  Florence  on  the  way  to  Rome  for  his
coronation,  and  on  this  occasion  the  chronicler  makes  him
grant  the  city  a  territory  of  six  miles  in  extent,  that  is,
one  as  big  again,  but  no  less  imaginary,  than  that  bestowed
by  Charlemagne.  Villani  goes  on  to  relate  how  Otho
established  peace  in  Italy,  overthrew  tyrants,  and  left  many
of  his  barons  settled  in  Lombardy  and  Tuscany,  the
Counts  Guidi  and  Uberti  among  the  rest.  He  fails  to
reflect  that  some  of  these  Tuscan  families  were  of  much
earlier  origin,  and  that  even  in  his  own  day  the  leading
nobles  of  the  contado  bore  the  name  of  Cattani  Lombardi,

«  Villani,  iii.  3.  '  Ibid.,  iv.  i.


yi  THE  ORIGIN  OP  FLORENCE.

in  remembrance  of  their  Longobard  descent.  Also,  he
again  forgets  that  Florence  was  not  then  a  free  city  to
whom  the  emperor  could  concede  a  portion  of  territory,
which,  as  we  have  seen,  already  belonged  to  his  own
jurisdiction,  and,  towards  Fiesole  at  least,  could  not
possibly  be  of  six  miles  in  extent.^

Another  fabulous  narrative,  also  given  by  Villani,  is
that  of  the  destruction  of  P'iesole  in  loio.  On  the  day
of  St.  Romolo's  feast  the  Florentines,  bent  on  revenge,
are  supposed  to  have  entered  the  rival  city  with  arms  con-
cealed under  their  clothes,  and  suddenly  drawing  their
weapons  and  summoning  comrades  hidden  in  ambush,  to
have  rushed  through  the  streets,  seizing  everything  and
destroying  all  houses  and  buildings  excepting  the  bishop's
palace,  the  cathedral,  two  or  three  churches,  and  the
fortress,  which  refused  to  surrender.  After  this,  safety
was  promised  to  all  disposed  to  migrate  into  Florence,  and
many  profited  by  the  offer.  Thus  the  two  peoples  were
made  one,  and  even  their  flags  united.  That  of  the
Florentines  bore  the  white  lily  on  a  red  field,  that  of
Fiesole  a  demi  lune  azur  on  a  white  field ;  and  thus  was
formed  the  red  and  white  banner  of  the  Commune.^

According  to  Villani  this  union  of  two  separate  peoples
proved  the  chief  cause  of  the  continual  wars  by  which
Florence  was  harassed,  together  with  the  fact  of  the  city
being  built  "  under  the  sway  and  influence  of  the  planet
Mars,  the  which  always  leads  to  war  and  discord."  Then
again,  as  though  forgetting  he  had  already  made  the  same
statement  regarding  the  times  of  Charlemagne,  he  repeats
the  almost  equal  anachronism  that  the  Florentines  '*  then
made  common  laws  and  statutes,  and  lived  under  the  rule
of  two  consuls  and  a  council  of  senators,  consisting  of  a
hundred    men,    the    best  of  the    city,   according    to   the

custom  introduced  in  Florence  by  the  Romans." '     It  Is
plain  that  he  does  not  know  how  the  Commune  arose,  but
feels   persuaded   its   origin  was  derived  from  Rome,  and
therefore  records  the  fact  as  having  occurred  at  the  moment
suiting  him  best,  or  seeming  least  improbable.     But  it  is
hard  to  see  why  he  assigned  the  war  and  destruction  of  Fie-
sole  to  the  year  1 010  when  aware  that  those  events  occurred,
on  the  contrary,  in  1125,  as  he  afterwards  relates  in  due
place.     The  most  probable  explanation  is,  that  finding  the
legend  gave  an  account  of  the  war  and  overthrow  of  Fie-
sole  more  than  jive  hundred  years  after  the  destruction  of
Florence  by  Totila,  whose  invasion  occurred  five  hundred
years  after  the  city  was  founded,  the  chronicler  described
the  destruction   twice  over,  namely,  in    10 10  and   11 25;
thus    following    first    the    legendary  account,  which   had
retraced  its  steps  in  a  very  vague  fashion,  and  next  the
historical  account,  commonly  known  in  his  day.     As  for
the    causes  of   civil   war  being  derived  from  the  forced
junction  of  two  hostile  nationalities,  it  may  be  observed
that    the   diversity  between   the  Germanic  strain   in  the
nobility  and  the  Latin  blood  of  the  people,  really  consti-
tuted a  strong  element  of  discord,  and  this  may  have  been
felt,  if  not  understood,  by  the  chronicler.

It  is  certain  that  from  the  Frankish  times  downward
the  prosperity  of  Florence  slowly  but  surely  increased.
Nevertheless  it  is  true  that,  as  Villani  says,  its  whole  terri-
tory bristled  with  the  castles  of  feudal  barons  of  Germanic
descent,  all  hostile  to  Florence,  and  many  of  whom,  safely
ensconced  on  the  neighbouring  hill  of  Fiesole,  were  always
ready  to  swoop  down  on  Florentine  soil.

In  spite  of  this  the  geographical  position  of  the  city,
on  the  road  to  Rome,  proved  increasingly  advantageous
to  its  commerce.  As  early  as  825  the  Costitutiones
olonenses  of  the  Emperor  Lothair  proposed  Florence,  with

'  Villani,  iv.  7.


74  THE  ORIGIN  OF  FLORENCE.

seven  other  Italian  cities,  as  the  seat  of  a  public  school,
thus  attesting  its  importance  even  at  that  date.     Besides,
the  German  emperors  nearly  always  halted  there  on  their
way  to  coronation  in  Rome.     More  often,  and  for  longer
periods,  the  Popes  made  sojourn  there,  whenever — a  by
no   means   uncommon    occurrence — popular   disturbances
expelled  them  from  Rome.    Victor  II.  died  in  Florence
in  1057,  and  had  held  a  council  there  two  years  before;
in    1058   Stephen  IX.  drew  his  last  breath  there  ;  three
years   later  Nicholas   II.  and  his  cardinals  stayed  in  the
town  pending    the    election    of  Alexander   II.      Full   of
Roman   traditions  and  monuments,  in  continual  relation
with  the  Eternal  City,  Florence  was  subject  to  its  influence
from  the  earliest  times,  and  showed  the  Guelph  and  religious
tendencies  afterwards  increasingly  prominent  in  the  course
of  her  history.     Towards  the  close  of  the  tenth  century
many  new  churches  arose  within   and  without  the  city
walls.      At  the   beginning   of  the   eleventh   century  the
construction  of  an  edifice  such  as  San  Miniato  al  Monte,  in
addition  to  the  other  churches  built  about  the  same  period,
affords   indubitable   proof  of  awakening    prosperity  and
religious  zeal.     In  fact,  Florence  now  became  one  of  the
chief  centres   of  the    movement   in    favour  of  monastic
reform  that,  after  its   first  manifestation  at  Cluny,  spread
so  widely  on  all  sides.     St.  Giovanni  Gualberto,  of  Floren-
tine birth,  who  died  in   1073,  inaugurated  the  reformed
Benedictine  order  known  by  the  name  of  Vallombrosa,  in
which  place  he  founded  his  celebrated  cloister,  and  subjected
many  of  the  monasteries  near  Florence  to  the  same  rule.

Before  long  this  religious  and  monastic  zeal  burnt  so
fiercely  in  Florence,  that  when  its  bishop,  Pietro  da  Pavia,
was  accused  of  simony,  all  the  people  rose  against  him.
The  friars  declared  that  he  owed  his  high  office  to  the
favour  of  the  emperor,  and  of  Duke  Goffredo  and
Beatrice   his   wife,  and   that   he  had  bought  their  pro-

tection  at  a  very  heavy  price.  The  multitude  sided
with  the  friars,  and  the  quarrel  was  carried  on  for  five
years  (1063-68),  and  with  so  much  heat  as  to  lead  to
bloodshed.  The  bishop,  enraged  by  these  accusations,
and  emboldened  by  the  duke's  favour,  caused  an  armed
attack  to  be  made  on  the  monastery  of  San  Salvi  near
Florence.  The  first  promoter  of  the  religious  movement,
St.  Giovanni  Gualberto,  was,  fortunately  for  him,  else-
where at  the  time ;  but  his  altars  were  pillaged  and  several
of  his  monks  injured.  This  incident  naturally  added
fuel  to  the  fire,  and  St.  Giovanni  Gualberto,  who  had
already  inflamed  men's  minds  by  preaching  in  the  city
streets,  now  cast  aside  all  reserve,  and  openly  declared  that
no  priests  consecrated  by  a  simoniacal  bishop  were  real
members  of  the  clergy.  The  popular  excitement  rose  to
so  high  a  pitch,  that  it  is  asserted  that  about  a  thousand
persons  preferred  to  die  unassoiled,  rather  than  receive  the
sacrament  from  priests  ordained  by  a  bishop  guilty  of
simony.^  Strange  though  it  seem,  this  was  by  no  means
incredible  in  times  of  earnest  religious  faith  !

Pope  Alexander  II.  vainly  endeavoured  to  pacify  the
people ;  vainly  sent  the  pious,  learned,  and  eloquent  St.
Pier  Damiano  to  achieve  that  end.  The  holy  man  came
with  the  words  of  peace,  afterwards  repeated  in  his  letters
addressed  to  Dilectis  in  Christo  civibus  florentinis.  He
censured  simony,  but  likewise  blamed  too  easy  credence
of  the  charge.  It  were  better,  he  said,  for  the  Florentines
to  send  representatives  to  the  Synod  in  Rome,  whose
authority  would  decide  the  quarrel  ;  meanwhile  they
must  remain  quiet,  without  yielding  to  the  blind  and
heinous  illusion  that  had  left  so  many  to  die  without  the
"sacraments"  to  their  souls'  peril.  Woe  to  those  who  seek
to  be  juster  than  the  just,  wiser  than  the  wise.  Through
too   great    zeal,   they    end    by  joining    the    foes    of  the

76  THE  ORIGIN  OF  FLORENCE.

Church.  Croaking  even  as  frogs  (yelut  ranae  in  paludi-
bus)^  they  throw  everything  into  confusion,  and  may  be
likened  to  the  plague  of  locusts  in  Egypt,  since  they
bring  equal  destruction  on  the  Church.^

This  movement  much  resembled  that  carried  on  about
the  same  time  by  the  Patarini  in  Milan  against  the
simony  of  the  archbishop.  There  too,  as  in  Florence,
St.  Pier  Damiano  played  the  part  of  peacemaker,  and
there  also  many  preferred  to  die  unassoiled,  rather  than
take  the  sacrament  from  simoniacal  priests.^  But,  despite
the  resemblance  of  the  two  insurrections,  they  led  to
different  final  results,  owing  to  the  different  conditions  of
the  two  cities,  and  the  very  diverse  attitude  respectively
assumed  towards  them  by  the  Court  of  Rome.  At  any
rate,  the  exhortations  of  St.  Pier  Damiano  had  no  effect
in  Florence.  The  Vallombrosa  monks  sent  representatives
to  Rome,  but  only  to  declare  before  the  Council,  then  in
session,  their  readiness  to  decide  the  question  by  appeal
to  the  judgment  of  God.  Not  only  was  their  proposal
rejected  by  Pope  and  Council,  but  they  were  also  severely
censured  for  suggesting  it,  although  the  Archdeacon
Hildebrand,  there  present,  who  had  already  risen  to  great
authority  in  the  Church,  tried  to  defend  them,  as  he  had
previously  defended  the  Patarini  of  Milan.  The  Council
ordered  the  monks  to  withdraw  to  their  monasteries,  and
abide  in  them  quietly,  without  daring  again  to  inflame
minds  already  unduly  excited.  St.  Giovanni  Gualberto
would  have  obeyed  willingly  now  ;  but  it  was  too  late  :
he  could  no  longer  quell  the  storm  he  had  raised.  For
when  the  populace  heard  of  what  the  monks  had  proposed
in    Rome,    they    insisted    on    the   ordeal    by    fire.      The

champion  chosen  for  the  purpose,  already  prepared  and
impatient  to  stand  the  test,  was  a  certain  Brother  Pietro,
of  Vallombrosa,  afterwards  known  by  the  name  of  Pietro
Igneo,  who,  according  to  some  writers,  had  been  cowherd
to  the  monastery,  although  others  assert  him  to  have
belonged  to  the  noble  family  of  the  Counts  Aldobrand-
eschi  of  Sovana.  Guglielmo,  surnamed  Bulguro,  of  the
Counts  of  Borgonuovo,  offered  the  monks  a  free  arena
for  the  ordeal,  close  to  the  Abbey  of  San  Salvatore,  in  his
patronage,  at  Settimo,  five  miles  from  Florence.  ^  The
bishop,  however,  not  only  rejected  the  challenge  with
indignation,  but  obtained  a  decree  to  the  effect  that  who-
ever, whether  of  the  Church  or  the  laity,  should  refuse  to
obey  his  authority,  the  same  would  be  seized,  bound,  and
not  led,  but  dragged  before  the  chief  of  the  city.2     Like-

included  in  the  Laurentian  Cod.  xx.  22,  in  sec.  xi.  The  letter  placed  at
the  end  of  the  Codex  itself  is  written  in  a  different  and  somewhat  later
hand  ;  but,  according  to  the  opinion  of  Prof.  Paoli,  who  examined  it  at
my  request,  the  writing  has  every  characteristic  of  the  eleventh  century,
"  and  could  not  possibly  be  of  later  date  than  the  first  half,  or  rather  first
quarter  of  the  twelfth  century."  It  more  resembles  a  narrative  in  an
epistolary  form  than  a  genuine  letter.  The  title  given  it  in  the  Codex
also  supports  this  view  :  "  Incipit  textus  miraculi  quod  Dominus,"  &:c.  We
shall  have  to  recur  to  the  subject  later  on.

At  any  rate,  it  is  plain  that  the  Potestas  above  mentioned  has  no  rela-
tion with  the  Podestk  of  a  later  period.  Here  the  term  signifies  superior
authority — i.e.,  that  of  the  Duke  Goffredo.  The  Preside  I  consider  to
mean  Goffredo's  representative  in  Florence.  Both  are  old-fashioned,
rhetorical  terms,  similar  to  those  afterwards  employed  by  Sanzanome.


78  THE  ORIGIN  OF  FLORENCE.

"Wise  the  goods  of  all  persons  having  fled  In  alarm  were  to
be  confiscated  by  the  Potestd^  that  is,  by  Duke  Goffredo,
who  favoured  the  bishop.  Meanwhile,  certain  rebellious
ecclesiastics  who  had  sought  refuge  in  an  oratory,  ^  were
driven  from  it  by  force.  Naturally,  these  measures  only
increased  the  heat  of  the  popular  fury.  Pietro  Igneo
declared  his  readiness  to  pass  through  the  fire,  and,  if
need  be,  alone.  On  February  13,  1068,  an  enormous
crowd  of  men,  women  (some  about  to  be  mothers),  old
people,  and  children,  set  forth  to  Settimo,  chanting  prayers
and  psalms  by  the  way.  There,  by  the  Badia,  two  piles
of  wood  were  fired,  and,  as  related  by  one  who  claims  to
have  witnessed  the  sight,  the  friar  passed  through  the
roaring  flames  miraculously  unhurt.  This  aroused  an
indescribable  enthusiasm  ;  the  sky  echoed  with  cries  of
joy,  and  Pietro  Igneo,  though  unscathed  by  the  fire,  was
nearly  crushed  to  death  by  the  throng  pressing  round  him
to  kiss  the  hem  of  his  robe.  With  great  difficulty,  and
only  by  main  force,  some  ecclesiastics  succeeded  in  rescu-
ing him.2  The  news  flew  to  Rome  with  lightning  speed,
and  then,  when  all  the  details  reached  the  Pope's  ear,  he
was  compelled  to  bow  to  the  miracle.  The  bishop  of
Florence  retired  to  a  monastery  ;  Pietro  Igneo  was  named
cardinal,  made  bishop  of  Albano,  and  worshipped  as  a
saint  after  his  death.

This  reminds  us  of  the  other  ordeal  by  fire  proposed  in
Florence  in  1498,  and  that  led  to  Savonarola's  martyrdom,

'  The  same  letter,  after  narrating  how  certain  persons,  having  taken
refuge  in  an  oratory,  were  threatened  with  expulsion,  "extra  Civitatem
pellerentur,"  unless  they  made  submission,  also  adds  that  those  persons
refused  to  obey.  "  Hincque  factum  est  ut  .  .  .  municipal  presid  .  .  .
illos  extra  emunitatem  oratori  .  .  .  eiceret."  The  two  abbreviated  words
in  the  Codex  were  printed  in  many  different  ways,  changing  the  verb
and  often  altering  the  whole  phrase,  to  the  reader's  great  confusion.
Several  colleagues  I  have  consulted  agree  with  my  view,  that  the  words
should  be  rendered  municipale  praesidium.

shortly  before  the  fall  of  the  Republic,  of  which  the  birth
and  death  would  thus  seem  to  have  been  preluded  by-
similar  events.  For,  albeit  the  account  of  the  affair  may
have  been  exaggerated  by  party  feeling  and  superstition,
and  although  the  terms  of  *'  Preside  "  and  *'  Podesta  "
employed  in  the  old  narrative  only  indicate  in  a  general
way  the  ruling  powers  in  Florence  at  the  time,  all
shows  that  a  new  state  of  society  had  begun.  We
find  that  there  was  a  Duke  of  Tuscany,  a  military
president,  apparently  his  representative  in  the  city,  and,
what  is  more,  a  people  which,  though  only  appearing
as  a  fanatic  mob,  is  plainly  conscious  at  last  of  its
own  strength,  since  it  struggles  against  the  bishop,
resists  both  the  duke  and  the  Pope,  and  finally  obtains
what  it  desires.  In  addressing  the  Pope  it  assumes
the  title  of  populus  florentinus  ;  and  is  addressed
by  St.  Pier  Damiano  as  cives  florentini.  It  is  true,  of
course,  that  these  were  mere  forms  of  speech  imitated  from
the  ancients  ;  assuredly  the  Commune  was  still  unborn,
and  much  time  had  yet  to  elapse  before  its  rise  ;  but  an
entirely  new  condition  of  things  had  begun,  in  which  the
elements  conducing  to  its  rise  were  already  in  course  of
preparation.  Accordingly,  we  must  now  retrace  our  steps,
in  order  to  study  the  question  more  closely.


CHAPTER  II.

THE  ORIGIN  OF  THE  FL01{EU^TItMiE  COMMUCX^'

I

HEN  the  Longobards  became  masters  of
nearly  the  whole  of  Italy,  and  subjected
it  to  their  long  and  cruel  sway,  they  are
known  to  have  appointed  a  duke  to
every  one  of  the  principal  cities  they
occupied.  Rome  remained  free  from
them,  having  a  Pope  ;  Ravenna  also  escaped  because
an  Exarch  was  soon  to  hold  rule  there,  and  almost
all  the  cities  by  the  sea  were  likewise  exem{)ted,  inas-
much as  the  Longobards  were  ignorant  of  navigation,
and  needed  assistance  for  their  maritime  trade.  It  was
for  the  same  reason  that  republics  such  as  Venice,  Amalfi,
Pisa,  Naples,  and  Gaeta,  were  of  earlier  origin  than  the
rest.  The  dukes  enjoyed  great  authority  and  independ-
ence ;  indeed,  some  of  the  duchies,  especially  on  the  borders,
became  so  extended  as  to  resemble  small  kingdoms — e.g.^
the  dukedoms  of  Friuli,  Spoleto,  and  Benevento.  This
circumstance  greatly  contributed  to  the  decomposition  of
the  kingdom  and  to  the  fall  of  the  Longobards,  whose
strength  and  daring  were  never  conjoined  with  any  real
political  capacity.

THE  AlARQUJSATE  OF  TUSCANY.  81

On  the  arrival  of  the  Franks,  counts  took  the  place  of
dukes,  but  with  less  power  and  smaller  territories.  Charle-
magne, with  his  genuine  talent  for  statesmanship,  refused
to  maintain  lords  who,  in  seeking  their  own  independence,
might  endanger  the  existence  of  his  empire.  Neverthe-
less, as  it  was  indispensable  to  keep  his  borders  more
strongly  defended,  he  constituted  marches^  on  the  pattern
of  the  greater  Longobard  duchies,  and  entrusted  them  to
margraves,  or  marquises  {^Mark-grafen — frontier  counts,
marquises,  or  margraves).  Thus  too  the  marquisate  of
Tuscany  was  formed  and  the  government  centred  in  Lucca ;
for  this  city  having  had  a  duke  of  its  own  ever  since  the
times  of  the  Longobards,  was  already  of  considerable  im-
portance, while,  as  we  have  seen,  Florence  had  fallen  so
low  that  the  documents  of  the  period  merely  refer  to  it
as  a  suburb  of  Fiesole.  Nearly  all  the  margraves  acquired
great  power,  and  aspired  to  still  higher  dignities.  From
their  ranks  in  fact  came  men  such  as  Hardouin  and  Beren-
garius,  who,  aspiring  to  form  an  Italian  kingdom,  became
formidable  opponents  of  the  Empire,  often  wrought  it
much  harm,  and  involved  it  in  sanguinary  wars.

Hence  it  is  not  surprising  if,  later  on,  the  policy  of
the  German  emperors  should  have  constantly  aimed  at  the
enfeeblement  of  the  leading  Italian  counts  and  margraves,
and,  by  granting  exemptions  and  benefices  to  prelates
or  lesser  feudatories,  and  making  all  benefices  conceded  to
the  latter  hereditary  estates,  rendered  these  independent  of
all  greater  and  more  dangerous  potentates.  Therefore,
particularly  in  Lombardy,  this  class  rose  to  importance,
and  so,  too,  the  political  authority  of  the  bishops,  who  in
point  of  fact  held  the  position  of  counts.  But  in  Tuscany
things  took  a  different  turn.  Whether  feudalism  there,
having  smaller  strength  and  power  of  expansion,  seemed
less  formidable  to  the  Empire ;  whether  the  country,  being
more  distant,  proved  less  easy  to  govern  ;  or  because  a

strong  state  in  central  Italy  was  felt  to  be  needed  to  arrest
the  growing  power  of  the  Papacy  ;  whether  the  latter  may
have  favoured  its  formation,  as  a  possible  check  to  the
Empire  ;  or  again,  as  seems  probable,  for  all  these  reasons
combined,  it  is  certain  that  the  dukes  or  marquises  of
Tuscany  (cither  title  was  borne  by  them)  increased  in
power  and  consequence,  and  afterwards,  in  their  turn,
became  a  danger  to  the  Empire.  But  in  Tuscany  the
power  of  bishops  and  counts  suffered  more  reduction  than
in  Lombardy  from  the  growing  strength  of  the  margraves,
whose  sway  was  extending  on  all  sides,  so  that  they  some-
times appear  to  be  virtual  sovereigns  of  central  Italy.  The
same  reasons  served  to  delay  the  rise  of  cities,  and  specially
hindered  that  of  Florence.

Already,  from  the  second  part  of  the  tenth  century,  a
Marquis  Ugo,  surnamed  the  Great,  of  Salic  descent,
ruled  over  Tuscany,  the  duchy  of  Spoleto  and  the  march
of  Camerino.  He  reigned  in  Lucca  almost  in  the  guise  of
an  independent  monarch,  and  enjoyed  the  favour  of  the
Othos.  His  successors  continued  to  govern  with  much
the  same  authority  as  the  dukes  of  Benevento ;  and  Boni-
fazio  III.  extended  his  State  even  to  Northern  Italy,  thus
giving  umbrage  to  Henry  III.,  whom  he  often  outrivalled
in  cunning.  Bonifazio  being  voracious  for  power,  and  of
tyrannical  temper,  stripped  many  prelates,  counts,  and
monasteries  of  their  possessions,  either  to  seize  them  in
his  own  grasp  or  give  them  to  better  trusted  vassals.  He
also  tightened  his  grasp  on  all  cities  which,  having  risen
to  some  importance,  coveted  increased  freedom.  This
was  specially  the  case  with  Lucca  and  Pisa.  The  former
had  prospered  through  being  long  the  chief  seat  of  the
duchy,  while  the  latter  owed  its  prosperity  to  the  sea,  on
which,  as  Amari  happily  phrased  it,  Pisa  was  already  a
free  city,  while  still  a  subject  city  on  land.  Florence,
however,  still   existed   in   humble   obscurity,  trading   in


CO  UNTESS  MA  TILDA.  ^3

a   small    way,    and    girt    about    on   all    sides    by    feudal
strongholds.

In  1037  Bonifazio  had  taken  to  wife  Beatrice  of  Lor-
raine, who  in  1046  gave  birth  to  a  daughter,  Matilda,  the
celebrated  countess  or  comitissa^  as  she  is  entitled  by  the
chroniclers.  After  the  death  of  Bonifazio,  by  assassination,
in  1052,  Matilda  was  soon  associated  with  her  mother  in
the  government  of  Tuscany  and  of  the  whole  duchy,  and
when  left  an  orphan  in  1076,  became  sole  ruler  of  those
extensive  dominions.  Beatrice  had  remarried,  and  as  she
was  very  religious,  and  her  second  husband,  GofFredo  of
Lorraine,  was  brother  to  Pope  Stephen  IX.,  this  served  to
increase  their  common  zeal  for  the  papal  policy,  afterwards
so  devotedly  pursued  by  Matilda.  When  this  high-
minded,  energetic  woman  became  sole  ruler,  she  held  the
reins  of  government  in  a  firm  grasp,  and  was  often  seen
on  battle-fields  with  a  sword  at  her  side.  Her  political
position  was  one  of  great  peril,  for  she  was  driven  to
take  part  in  the  fierce  quarrel,  recently  begun,  between
the  Church  and  the  Empire.  At  first  the  great,  high-
tempered  Hildebrand  conducted  the  struggle  as  the
inspiring  genius  of  various  Popes  ;  later  on,  when  raised
to  the  pontifical  Chair  as  Gregory  VII.,  he  fought  in
person  against  Henry  IV.  of  Germany,  and  found  Matilda
his  strongest  and  best  ally.  In  this  conflict,  stirring  and
dividing  all  Europe,  it  was  only  natural  that  many
opposing  passions  should  be  excited  in  Italy.  All  cities
that,  like  Pisa  and  Lucca,  considered  themselves  wronged
by  Duke  Bonifazio,  now  declared  for  the  Empire,  and
the  Empire  sided  with  them  against  Matilda.  The  same
course  was  followed  by  all  dissatisfied  feudatories,  especi-
ally by  those  whom  Bonifazio  had  stripped  of  their
possessions.  More  than  once,  it  is  true.  Countess  Matilda
seized  estates  which  had  been  arbitrarily  alienated ;  but
she  seldom  restored  them  to  their  original  owners,  pre-


^4       ORIGIN  OF  THE  FLORENTINE  COMMUNE,

ferring  instead  to  bestow  them  on  churches,  convents,  and
trusty  adherents  of  her  own.  This  added  fresh  fuel  to
the  flame.  Hence  an  increasingly  tangled  web  of
opposing  passions,  of  conflicting  interests,  from  which  at
last  some  profit  accrued  to  Florence.  The  Guelph  spirit
of  the  city  and  its  commercial  position,  on  the  highway
to  Rome,  had  from  the  outset  inclined  it  to  the  Church,
and  now,  as  a  declared  ally,  was  actively  favoured  by
Beatrice  and  Matilda.


II.

It  was  long  believed  that  Florence  had  had  Consuls,  and
consequently  an  independent  government,  from  the  year
ii02,since  Consuls  are  mentioned  in  a  treaty  of  that  date,
whereby  the  inhabitants  of  Pogna  swore  submission  to  the
city.  But  it  was  difficult  to  reconcile  this  fact  with  the
clearly  proved  dependence  of  Florence  on  Countess  Matilda
at  the  time.  It  was  afterwards  ascertained  that  the  docu-
ment in  question  bore  a  wrong  date,  and  that  the  correct
one  was  1182,  when  the  submission  of  Pogna  really  took
place.  Accordingly,  the  independence  of  the  city  was
transferred  to  after  1 1 15,  the  year  of  the  countess's  death.
But  it  was  still  difficult  to  explain  the  wars  previously
carried  on  by  the  city  on  its  own  account,  and  other  events
of  a  like  nature.  The  fact  is  that  no  fixed  year  can  be
assigned  to  the  birth  of  the  Florentine  Commune,  which
took  shape  very  slowly,  and  resulted  from  the  conditions
of  Florence  under  the  rule  of  the  last  dukes  or  marquises.
We  have  already  recorded  the  popular  riots  of  IC63-68
against  the  bishop  Mezzabarba,  when  accused  of  simony,
and  we  have  related  how  they  ended  with  the  ordeal  of
fire,  braved  by  Pietro  Igneo  in  1068.  On  this  head  we
have  cited  the  letters  of  St.  Pier  Damiano  addressed  civi-

bus  florentinis.  We  also  referred  to  a  document  ^  in
which  the  clerus  et  populus  florentinus  made  appeal  to
the  Pope,  and,  in  narrating  what  had  occurred,  mentioned
a  municipale  praesidium^  a  praeses  of  the  city,  and  a
superior  potestas.  This  proved,  before  all,  that  the  civic
body  of  the  period  was  already  conscious  of  its  personality,
and  that  there  was  already  an  embryo  local  government
within  the  city  walls.  Doubtless  the  supreme  potestas
was  the  Duke  Goffredo,  husband  to  Beatrice ;  the  praeses.,
his  representative  in  Florence.  It  was  before  him  that,
as  we  have  seen,  the  bishop  threatened  to  drag  his  adver-
saries, whose  property  was  to  be  confiscated  should  they
persist  in  disobedience.  This  preside  commanded  the
praesidiumy  designated  municipal  even  before  the  muni-
cipality had  come  into  being,  and  at  least  the  name  shows
that  the  majority  of  the  praesidium  must  have  consisted
of  citizens.  But  all  this  makes  it  equally  plain  that,
while  Florence  was  still  an  integral  part  of  the  margra-
viate,  Roman  forms,  traditions,  and  ideas  already  prevailed
there  to  the  extent  of  assigning  Roman  names  to  institu-
tions of  feudal  origin.  We  must  pause  to  consider  this
fact,  since  it  gave  rise  to  a  question,  not  only  of  form,  but
of  genuine  historical  importance.

The  employment  of  Roman  terms  need  cause  little  sur-
prise when  we  remember  that  the  study  of  elementary
Roman  law,  as  well  as  of  rhetoric,^  the  ars  dictandi  then
formed  part  of  the  Triviumy  and  was  therefore  widely
taught  in  Italy.  In  the  first  half  of  the  eleventh  century
a  still  more  advanced  study  of  law  already  flourished  at
the  school  of  Ravenna,  and  as  its  influence  increased,
extended  through  Romagna  into  Tuscany.  This  system
of  law  seemed  to  spring  to  life  again  spontaneously  from
the  midst  of  Latin  populations,  with  whom  it  had  never

entirely  died  out,  and  now  in  its  new  vigour  brought
modifications  and  changes  into  the  different  institutions
and  legislations  with  which  it  came  in  contact.^  In  fact,
in  the  sentences  pronounced  by  Beatrice  and  Matilda,  we
find  occasional  quotations  from  the  Digesto^  or  Code,  that,
according  to  the  procedure  of  the  time,  was  carried  to  the
tribunals  by  those  basing  their  rights  on  its  clauses.^  The
works  of  St.  Pier  Damiano  afford  satisfactory  proof  that
the  Florentines  pursued  the  same  study,  and  set  great
value  on  Roman  law.  The  saint  mentions  a  juridical  dis-
pute of  the  Florentines,  regarding  which,  towards  the
middle  of  the  eleventh  century,  they  had  asked  the
opinion  of  the  sapientes  of  Ravenna,  who,  much  to  his
own  disgust,  presumed  to  alter  the  prescriptions  of  canoni-

TUSCAN  TRIBUNALS,  87

deduced  from  the  remark  previously  made  by  Ficker,'
namely,  that  the  courts  held  in  Florence  and  its  territory
were  seldom  attended  by  the  Romagnol  assessors,  or
causidiciy  frequenting  other  Tuscan  tribunals.  This
would  seem  to  imply  that  in  this  respect  Florentines  had
no  need  to  recur  to  Romagna.  Later — that  is  towards
the  end  of  the  century — the  school  of  Irncrius  (Werner)
began  to  flourish  at  Bologna,  the  which  school  aimed  at
an  exact  reproduction  of  Roman  law  and  promoted  its
genuine  revival.  But  at  the  time  of  which  we  speak  the
Ravenna  school  represented,  on  the  contrary,  a  continua-
tion of  the  ancient  jurisprudence,  partly  decayed  and
partly  changed  by  the  diverse  elements  of  civilisation  in
the  midst  of  which  it  had  survived,  and  in  which  it  was
now  producing  radical  changes.*  One  of  these  changes —
leading  to  very  remarkable  consequences  of  a  political  as
well  as  a  legal  kind — took  place  in  the  constitution  and
attributes  of  the  margravial  tribunal.

We  know  that  Matilda,  after  the  fashion  of  her  prede-
cessors, administered  justice  in  the  name  of  the  Empire,
presiding  in  state  over  the  tribunals.  Indeed,  this  was
one  of  her  chief  functions.     Some  sentences  given  by  her

sapientes  of  Ravenna,  in  contradiction  to  the  canonical  law,  as  to  the
degrees  of  relationship  prohibiting  marriage.  Touching  a  wise  man  he
asserts  to  be  a  Florentine,  he  adds  :  "  promptulus  cerebrosus  ac  dicax,
scilicet  acer  ingenio,  mordax  eloquio  vehemens  argumento."

•  Ficker  says,  in  mentioning  the  before-quoted  document  of  1061  :
"  Diese  Romagnolen  scheinen  nun  weiter  kaum  nur  zufallig  zu  Florenz
gewesen  zu  sein."

"  As  regards  the  ever-increasing  action  of  Roman  law  in  Tuscany
there  is  a  very  remarkable  passage  in  the  Pisan  Statutes  of  1161,  in
which  it  is  said  of  that  city,  "amultis  retro  temporibus,  vivendo  lege
romana,  retentis  quibusdam  de  lege  longobarda."  In  a  Siennese  document
of  1176,  edited  by  Ficker  (vol.  iv.  doc.  148),  the  Consuls  declare  :  "  Item
nos  professi  sumus  lege  romana  cum  tota  Civitate  vivere."  The  mixture  of
Roman  with  Longobard  or  other  legal  systems  is  very  frequent  throu^'^h-
out  the  whole  of  the  eleventh  century,  and  even  later  on.  Often,  women
who  proiessed  to  live  according  to  the  Roman  law,  declared  themselves
at  the  same  time  as  being  under  the  mundium  of  their  sons  or  of  others.

have  survived,  and  serve  to  show  us  how  her  tribunal  was
composed.  Certain  high  feudatories  had  seats  flanking
her  throne  ;  next  came  the  judges,  assessors,  pleaders
(causidici)y  and  witnesses,  and  lastly,  the  notary.  Prof.
Lami  has  observed  that  the  judges,  and  more  paiiticularly
the  assessors,  were  changed  as  the  countess  moved
from  city  to  city,  which  would  prove  that  not  a  few  of
them  were  inhabitants  of  the  towns  wherein  they  adminis-
tered justice.^  In  fact,  what  names  do  we  find  among
them  in  Florence  ?  Those  of  the  Gherardi,  Caponsacchi,
Uberti,  Donati,  Ughi,  and  a  few  others.^  These  were
already  the  first  and  most  influential  citizens,  the  hcni
homines^  the  sapientes,  the  men  we  afterwards  find  ofiicia-
ting  as  Consuls.  Thus  there  were  certain  families  who
first  formed  part  of  the  margravial  tribunal,  and  were
afterwards  at  the  head  of  the  Commune.

Political  changes  were  facilitated  and  prepared  by  a
juridical  change,  followed  by  the  increased  action  of  the
revived  Roman  law.  What  was  the  nature  of  this
change .?  The  exact  definition  of  the  functions  respec-
tively assigned  by  the  Germanic  code  to  the  president  of
the  tribunal  who  gave  sentence,  or  to  the  judges  who  led
up  to  the  same  by  administering  the  law,  had  been
gradually  lost  sight  of.  Sometimes  the  countess  pro-
nounced sentence  without  the  aid  of  judges  ;  but  more
often  they  conducted  the  trial,  applied  the  law,  and  formu-
lated the  verdict,  to  which  the  countess  merely  gave
assent.     Thus,   as   Ficker  states,  her  ofiice   was  reduced

FIRST  SIGNS  OF  CIVIC  INDEPENDENCE,        89

to  that  of  a  passive  president.^  This  is  confirmed  on  seeing
that  tribunals  sometimes  sat  in  her  absence,  when  the  trials
were  entirely  managed  by  the  judges.  A  method  of  this
kind  once  adopted,  Matilda's  grave  and  numerous  affairs
of  State,  together  with  the  continual  warfare  in  which  she
was  involved,  must  have  augmented  the  number  of  the
cases  settled  by  local  judges.  This  must  have  been  a
matter  of  weighty  importance  at  a  time  when  the  adminis-
tration of  justice  was  one  of  the  principal  attributes  of
political  sovereignty.  Hence  these  citizen  tribunals  are
a  precursory  sign  of  civic  independence  before  the  Com-
mune had  asserted  its  real  autonomy  and  individual
position.  The  strange  dearth  of  documents  certifying
that  any  tribunal  in  Florence  was  presided  over  by
Matilda  during  the  last  fifteen  years  of  her  hfe,  serves  to
confirm  our  remarks.  A  similar  fact  is  also  verified  in
the  Tuscan  cities  remaining  faithful  to  the  Empire ;  for
these  too  had  tribunals  in  which  justice  was  administered,
not  by  feudal  potentates,  but  by  citizens  invested  by  the
emperor  with  judicial  authority.^  These,  too,  served  as  a
preliminary  to  communal  independence,  although  hardly
forming,  as  some  thought,  its  actual  beginning.

It  is  certain  that  in  this  and  other  ways,  during  the
contest  between  Henry  IV.  and  Matilda,  many  Tuscan
cities,  siding  either  with  the  Empire  or  the  Church,  and
therefore  highly  favoured  by  the  one  or  the  other,  were
able  to  achieve  a  commencement  of  freedom.  After
Henry  IV.  had  defeated  Matilda  near  Mantua  in  108 1  he
granted  large  privileges  to  Pisa  and  Lucca,  in  return  for
their  proofs  of  goodwill  to  his  cause.     In  a  letter  patent

'  ^''Unthd/iger  Vorsitzende"  says  Ficker,  when  clearly  proving  this  fact.

issued  at  Rome  June  23,  1081,  he  not  only  guaranteed
to  Lucca  the  integrity  of  its  walls,  but  also  authorised
it  to  forbid  the  construction  of  any  castles  in  the  city  or
territory  within  a  circuit  of  six  miles,  and  promised  to
exempt  it  from  building  an  Imperial  palace.  He  likewise
declared  that  no  Imperial  envoy  should  be  sent  to  give
judgment  in  Lucca,  but  made  a  reservation  in  case  of  the
personal  presence  there  of  the  emperor,  or  his  son,  or  his
chancellor.  In  conclusion,  he  annulled  the  "  evil
customs"  {^"perverse  consuetudini)  imposed  by  Bonifazio
III.'  to  the  hurt  of  Lucca,  and  granted  it  full  permission
to  trade  in  the  markets  of  San  Donnino  and  Capannori,
from  which  he  expressly  excluded  the  Florentines.  This
final  clause  not  only  proves  the  hostility  of  the  Empire  to
Florence,  but  the  importance  the  latter's  trade  must  have
assumed  by  that  time.  In  the  same  year  Pisa  received  a
patent  guaranteeing  the  maintenance  of  its  ancient  rights,
and  Henry  declared  that  no  Imperial  envoy  belonging  to
another  territory  should  be  sent  to  plead  suits  within  the
walls,  or  within  the  boundaries  of  its  contado.  And,
what  was  still  more  to  the  point,  he  also  declared  that  no
marquis  should  be  sent  into  Tuscany  without  the  consent
of  twelve  huoni  uomini  chosen  by  the  popular  assembly,
summoned  in  Pisa  by  sound  of  bell. 2   Here,  if  no  Consuls

yet  appear  on  the  scene,  we  already  find  their  precursors
in  these  worthies,  or  sapienteSy  elected  of  the  people,  and
we  have  already  a  popular  assembly.  Even  though  the
Commune  be  still  unborn,  its  birth  is  now,  as  it  were,
in  sight.  Further  (provided  nothing  was  interpolated  in
the  document),  it  is  most  remarkable  to  find  the  appoint-
ment of  an  Imperial  margrave  subject  to  the  sanction  of
the  people.  There  is  also  a  hinted  desire — unattainable
during  Matilda's  life — to  assume  the  government  of  the
margraviate  in  person  ;  after  her  death  an  attempt  to
this  eflfect  was  actually  made,  but,  as  we  shall  see,  with
very  brief  and  partial  success.


V  III.

Nevertheless  the  condition  of  Florence  was  considerably
different  from  that  of  Pisa  or  Lucca.  These  two  cities,
as  we  have  seen,  had  long  enjoyed  greater  prosperity.
They  had  often  fought  against  each  other  ;  Pisa,  haughty
and  daring  by  sea,  had  begun,  even  in  the  middle  of
the  tenth  century,  a  long  and  arduous  war  against  the
Mussulmans  ^  of  Sicily,  Spain,  and  Africa,  Florence,  on
the  other  hand,  in  siding  with  Matilda,  became  necessarily
the  foe  of  all  the  great  feudal  nobles  of  the  contado^
surrounding  the  city  on  all  sides,  and  who,  disgusted
by  their  treatment  at  the  hands  of  the  marquises  of  Tus-
cany, since  the  time  of  Bonifazio  III.,  now,  for  the  most
part,  adhered  to  the  Empire.  Their  antagonism  towards
the  Florentines  was  not  only  heightened  by  the  fact
of  these  nobles  being  of  Germanic  origin,  even  as  feudal
institutions  were  Germanic,  whereas  the  population  of
Florence,  consisting  chiefly  of  artisans,  was  of  Roman
origin  and  full  of  Roman  traditions  ;  but  it  was  likewise

'  .Am^ri,  "  Storia  dei  Musulmani  in  Sicilig,"  vol.  iii.  p.  i  and  foL


92       ORIGIN  OF  THE  FLORENTINE  COMMUNE

increased  by  the  geographical  position  of  the  city.  Had
Florence  been  situated  in  a  plain  like  Pisa  and  Lucca,  or
like  Sienna  and  Arezzo  on  a  height,  the  feudal  nobility
could  have  promoted  their  interests  better  by  settling
within  its  walls.  But  it  lay  in  a  valley  in  the  midst  of
a  girdle  of  hills  bristling  with  feudal  turrets,  whence  the
nobles  threatened  it  on  all  sides,  raiding  its  lands  and
closing  all  outlets  for  its  commerce.

These  geographical  conditions  had  no  slight  effect  on
the  future  destiny  of  Florence  ;  and,  in  fact,  largely  con-
tributed to  form  the  special  character  of  its  history.  As
a  primary  result,  conflict  between  the  feudal  nobles  and
the  city  was  more  inevitable  and  more  sanguinary  than
elsewhere,  while  the  city  being,  from  the  first,  of  far
more  democratic  temper  than  the  rest,  was  therefore
longer  prevented  from  asserting  its  independence,  since
this  result  could  only  be  achieved  when  Florence  had
gained  sufficient  strength  to  cope  with  the  numerous
enemies  girding  it  about.  Until  that  moment  arrived  its
interests  were  best  forwarded  by  remaining  friendly  and
submissive  to  Countess  Matilda,  the  only  power  able  to
hold  the  barons  in  check,  and  the  loss  of  whose  aid  would
have  left  Florence  a  prey  to  its  foes.  This  explains  not
only  the  city's  delay  in  asserting  its  independence,  but
also  the  total  lack  of  documents  concerning  the  origin  of
a  commune  that  had  already  risen  to  considerable  strength,
and  started  wars  on  its  own  account  before  its  existence
was  officially  recognised.  These  wars  were  still  carried
on  in  the  name  of  the  Countess,  who  occasionally  visited
the  camp  in  person  ;  the  city  was  unmentioned  in  public
documents,  because  it  had  as  yet  no  personal  existence.
Nevertheless,  we  are  forced  to  recognise  the  first  signs
of  its  communal  life  in  the  campaigns  undertaken  by
Florence  in  defence  of  its  trade  against  the  nobles  of
the  contado;  the  which  campaigns  were  continued  on  an


94       ORIGIN  OF  THE  FLORENTINE  COMMUNE.

The  term  milites^  it  is  true,  frequently  occurs  in
Florentine  records  ;  but  although  the  milites  could  not
htpopolaniy  since  the  lower  classes  were  not  then  admitted
to  knighthood,  neither  could  they  be  feudal  nobles  in
Florence  :  they  were  the  leading  citizens  who  exercised  no
trade,  the  grandi^  in  fact,  to  whom  we  have  previously
alluded.  They  were  members  of  Matilda's  courts,  were
employed  by  her  in  various  ways  ;  they  commanded  the
municipal  praesidium^  probably  filled  the  office  of  praeses,
and  they  were  leaders  of  the  army.  Richer,  more  culti-
vated and  better  fitted  than  other  citizens  for  politics  and
warfare  by  their  freedom  from  daily  toil,  they  were  the
l^oni  viriy  the  sapiences,  the  milites  found  more  or  less
in  all  cities,  but  of  a  separate  stamp  in  Florence.

Notwithstanding  our  knowledge  of  this  preside  and
presidio  and  of  these  Florentine  tribunals,  very  little  is
known  as  to  the  government  and  administration  of  the
social  body  already  beginning  to  prosper  and  to  have
varied  interests  of  its  own.  Matilda's  sway  in  Florence
must  have  been  of  a  shadowy  kind,  when  the  city  was
able  to  start  wars  on  its  own  account  and  to  its  own
profit,  albeit  still  undertaken  in  her  name.  As  its  com-
mercial prosperity  increased  and  Matilda  became  more
absorbed  in  her  struggle  with  the  Empire,  the  city  must
have  been  left  more  to  itself  Consequently  this  is
the  time  when  the  associations  serving  to  classify  and
organise  the  citizens  were  formed,  which  we  presently
find  flourishing  and  strongly  established.  Thus,  being
almost  without  a  central  government,  a  local  one  could
assert  its  existence,  and  the  strength  of  the  Commune
be  developed  long  before  its  independence  was  pro-
claimed. The  same  fact  explains  why  the  Commune,  its
individuality  once  declared,  should  have  made  such  rapid
progress  and  leapt  to  the  headship  of  Tuscany.  At  any
rate,  by  the  second  half  of  the  twelfth  century  we  find


DEVELOPMEJSIT  OF  TRADE  GUILDS.  95

on  the  one  side  the  grandly  or  nobles — if  we  prefer  to
give  them  that  name — formed  in  Societies  of  Towers
\Societa  delle  torri),  with  statutes  soon  to  be  made  known
to  us  ;  while,  on  the  other  we  find  trade  guilds  or
associations  not  only  in  existence,  but  sometimes  with
sufficient  political  importance  to  entitle  them  to  the
honour  of  representing  the  Republic.  Can  we  possibly
suppose  that  such  results  could  be  achieved  without  a
long,  preliminary  course  of  preparation?  Did  not  the
scholaCy  progenitors  of  the  guilds,  survive  during  the
Lower  Empire  and  throughout  the  Middle  Ages?  do
we  not  find  them  dividing  all  society,  including  both
the  soldiery  and  foreigners  in  Rome  and  in  Ravenna  ?
How  could  they  be  destroyed  by  barbarians  ignorant  of
crafts  which  were  nevertheless  indispensable  to  their
own  needs  ?

Florentine   commerce    and    industry   undoubtedly   in-
creased during  the  rule  of  Countess  Matilda.     This  has
been  proved   by  the  patent  of  io8i,  and  the  first  wars
undertaken    by  the   Florentines  in    the  interest  of  their
trade  afford   sure   confirmation    of  the  fact.     Were   we
to  exclude  trade  associations  from  the  conditions  of  the
period,  we  should  have  to  admit  the  existence,  at  that
day,  of  the  modern  workman,  isolated  and  independent  :
a  decided  impossibility  in  the  Middle  Ages.     Those  were
times   in    which    every   trade    was    exercised    by   distinct
groups   of  families,    and   handed   down   by   them    as   a
tradition  from  father  to  son.     Frequently,  even  offices  of
the  State  were  the  monopoly  of  certain  families.     It  was
from    a   society    split    into    groups    and    castes  that    the
Commune  eventually  developed  the  modern  State,  but  in
old  times  the  very  idea  of  the  latter  was  unconceived.
It  is  absurd  to  suppose — though  a  few  writers  accept  the   .
notion — that  the  guilds  only  began  when  they  had  regular
statutes.    These  statutes  only  formulated  what  had  already


96       ORIGIN  OF  THE  FLORENTINE  COMMUNE.

existed  for  some  time,  and  undoubtedly  in  Florence  every-
thing conduces  to  the  belief  that  the  associations  of  the
trades  and  of  the  towers,  though  still  embryonic,  must
have  preceded  the  formation  of  the  Commune  evolved
in  their  midst.

IV.

For  on  all  sides,  if  in  diverse  modes,  we  perceive  that
a  long  period  of  incubation  was  needed  to  form  the
Commune,  which  naturally  owed  its  birth  to  pre-existing
elements.  The  celebrated  agreement  or  concordia  made
at  Pisa  by  Bishop  Daiberto,  about  1090,  or  even,  per-
haps, a  year  or  so  earlier,  ^  shows  that  the  nobles  were
organised  and  waging  fierce  war  against  one  another
from  their  towers.  The  bishop  induced  them  to  parti)
demolish  these  towers,  and  solemnly  vow  never  to  carr\
them  above  the  height  of  thirty-six  braccia  (about  one
hundred  feet),  as  previously  decreed  by  the  patent  oi
Henry  IV.  in  108 1.2  And  the  agreement  proceedec
to  set  forth  that  any  man  believing  his  houses  to  have
been  unjustly  damaged  was  to  bear  his  complaint  ac
commune  Colloquium  Civitatis  ;  nor  could  the  dwelling  oj
the  offender  be  demolished  without  the  general  consent
of  the  citizens. 3

The  whole  tenor  of  this  document  not  only  proves  thai
the  Pisan  nobles  were  already  an  organised  body,  but  thai
they  also  boasted  a  civic  importance  never  attained  by  th(

yet,  or  they  would  have  been  certainly  mentioned  in  the
document.  But  all  the  elements  destined  to  make  it  a
far  more  aristocratic  commune  than  that  of  Florence  were
already  existent.^  We  see  that  there  was  a  commune
consilium  of  sapientes  or  boni  homines^  which  was  a
species  of  senate,  and  a  commune  colloquium^  a  general
assembly  of  all  the  citizens,  afterwards  developing  into
a  parliament  or  arrengo.  Five  sapientes^  whose  names
are  given,  sat  in  council  with  the  bishop. 2  These  were
the  immediate  precursors  or,  as  Pawinski  rightly  calls
them,  the  vorhilder  of  the  Consuls,  who  are  actually
mentioned  shortly  after  this  time,  in  1094,  in  another
agreement  {concordid)^  also  drawn  up  by  Daiberto.  He
makes  an  explicit  appeal  to  their  authority  {^hiiius  civitatis
consulibus)  in  decreeing  that  all  smiths  engaged  on  work
required  for  the  Duomo  should  be  left  unmolested. 3   Thus


'  But  I  cannot  agree  with  Pawinski  when,  in  noting  this  characteristic
of  Pisa  and  other  similar  communes,  he  neglects  the  popular,  commercial
element,  that  even  in  Pisa,  as  elsewhere,  was  very  influential,  and  con-
siders that  the  birth  of  the  Italian  Commune  should  be  solely  attributed
to  the  nobles.

*  "  Nisi  fortitan  communi  Consilio  Civitatis,  vel  maioris  partis  Bonorum

3  Murat.,  "  Antiq.,"  iii.,  1099.  A  poem  attributed  to  Guido  da  Pisa
narrates  the  campaign  of  1087  carried  on  by  the  Pisans,  in  alliance  with
Genoa,  Amalfi,  and  Rome,  against  the  Saracens  in  Africa,  and  cites  the
names  of  four  Pisans  : —

"  Vocat  ad  se  Petrum  et  Sismundum
Principales  Consules,

This,  however,  is  a  poetical  work,  and  in  order  to  accept  it  as  a  proof
that  these  Consuls  existed  in  1087  it  would  be  necessary  to  carry  back  to
that  year,  at  least,  the  first  concordia  of  Bishop  Daiberto.  This  might
not  be  impossible,  seeing  that  he  held  the  bishopric  from  1085  to  1092,
when  he  was  named  archbishop.    Vide  Pawinski,  p.  31,  note  3.   Leonardo

a


9?       ORIGIN  OF  THE  FLORENTINE  COMMUNE.

the  rise  of  the  Pisan  Commune  was  preceded  by  a  conflict
waged  by  belligerent  nobles  from  their  respective  towers,
and  the  Consuls  of  the  town  were  first  named  as  the
protectors  of  the  smiths.

The  existence  of  guilds  in  Venice  as  far  back  as  the
ninth  century  is  certified  by  the  Aitino  Chronicle,  proving
that,  even  then,  there  were  some  leading  industries  ex-
ercised by  certain  families  only,  and  that  humbler  trades,
or  ministerial  were  already  constituted,  as  it  were,  in
associations,  the  members  of  which  pursued  their  avoca-
tion according  to  traditional  and  definite  rules.  These
craft-guilds  or  ministeria  implied  certain  accompanying
obligations,  since  all  members  of  them  were  bound  to
yield  some  gratuitous  service  to  the  State.  On  the  other
hand,  the  higher  trades,  such  as  mosaic  work,  architecture,
and  so  on,  requiring  more  culture  and  talent,  were  exer-
cised by  the  leading  families,  and  members  of  these  guilds
remained  eligible  for  the  political  offices  of  the  State. ^

Vernese  recounts  the  expedition  to  the  Balearic  Isles  (ii  13-15)  in  his
"  Carmen,"  and  says  : —

"  Inde  duo  et  denos  de  culmine  nobilitatis
Constituere  viros,  quibus  est  permissa  potestas
Consulis  atque  ducis."

But  the  existence  of  Consuls  at  that  time  has  been  already  proved  by
other  documents.     Vide  Pawinski,  pp.  38-9.

'  The  chronicler  designates  the  chief  families  as  anteriores,  possibly
because  they  were  the  first  to  settle  in  Venice  ;  he  represents  them  as  a
supreme  and  governing  class,  and  in  the  list  he  gives  of  them  mentions
what  trades  they  carried  on.  "  Cerbani  de  Cerbia  venerunt,  anteriores
fuerunt  de  omni  artificio  ingeniosi.  Signati  (variant :  Cugnati)  Tribuni
lanni  appellati  sunt,  anteriores  fuerunt,  mirabilia  artificia  facere  sciebant
caliditate  ingenii.  Aberorlini  .  .  .  anteriores  fuerunt ;  non  aluid  opera-
bantur  nisi  negocia,  sed  advari  et  increduli."  And  so  on  regarding  other
families  exercising  from  generation  to  generation  the  same  trade,  com-
merce, or  liberal  profession.  As  to  the  guilds  or  ministeria,  we  find
many  expressions  affording  hints  of  their  embryo  organisation.  "  Hetolus
autem  appellatus  est,  quia  ipse  erat  princeps  de  his  qui  ministerii  erant
retinendis."  They  were  sadlers,  cattle-herds,  &c.  Many  more  of  these
families  are  named  in  the  list  given  in  the  Chronicle,  and  all  seems  to
denote  the  continuation  of  a  state  of  things  that  had  existed  during  the
lower  Empire.


ART  AND  TRADE  GUILDS.  99

rhere  Is  a  document  of  the  eleventh  century  showing
:hat  the  guild  of  smiths  was  constituted  under  the  rule  of
I  gastaldo  (or  steward),  against  whom  one  of  the  members
ippealed  for  justice  to  the  doge,  according  to  a  custom  as
^et  unwritten.  I  All  this  compels  us  to  believe  that  the
existence  of  art  and  trade  guilds,  and  in  general  of  all  the
issociations  into  which  the  citizens  of  the  communes  were
ifterwards  divided,  dates  from  a  very  remote  period,  and
:hat  in  Florence,  as  elsewhere,  all  similar  associations
ivere  constituted  before  the  Commune  had  proclaimed  its
ndependence.  Otherwise  it  would  be  impossible  to
explain  the  existence  of  a  city  that,  almost  without  any
visible  government,  was  already  prosperous  in  commerce
md  able  to  make  war  on  its  own  account.     For  otherwise

'  This  document  is  in  the  Vatican  (Urb.  440),  and  has  also  been
examined  by  Gfrorer.  The  ironsmith,  Giovanni  Sagomino,  "  insimul  cum
:unctis  meis  parentibus,"  appeals  first  to  the  Doge  Pietro  Barbolano  {1026-
51),  and  then  to  the  Doge  Domenico  Flabiabico  (1032-43),  against  the
gastaldo  of  the  guild,  who  sought  to  compel  him  to  labour  at  iron-work
for  the  prisons  in  the  palace  yard,  whereas  Sagornino  asserted  his  right,
iccording  to  custom,  of  makmg  the  iron-work  at  his  own  house,  when
Fulfilling  his  gratuitous  task  for  the  State.  A  regular  suit  was  carried  on ;
and  being  decided  in  favour  of  the  appellant,  the  latter  was  permitted  to
io  the  work  in  his  own  shop.  All  this  proves  that  well-defined  traditional
customs  prevailed  before  the  guild  possessed  written  statutes  (sec.  xiii.),
since  these  would  have  been  mentioned  had  they  existed  at  the  time.

The  document  we  have  quoted  speaks  at  one  point  of  the  gastaldo  of
the  doge,  and  at  another  alludes  to  him  as  the  gastaldo  of  the  smiths,
because  the  director  of  the  guild  held  his  nomination  from  the  doge.
This  is  clearly  evidenced  in  the  thirteenth  century  by  a  decree  <^pro-
missione)  of  the  Doge  Jacopo  Tiepolo,  dated  March  6,  1229,  and  by
another  of  the  Doge  Marco  Morosini  (June  13,  1249).  Thus  we  see,  on
the  one  hand,  how  much  the  organisation  of  the  Venetian  guilds  differed
from  that  of  the  Florentine,  while,  on  the  other,  we  note  how  ancient  and
persistent  in  all  Italian  communes  was  the  character  of  their  institutions
in  general  and  of  the  trade  guilds  in  particular.  For  the  details  given  in
this  and  the  preceding  note  we  are  indebted  to  Prof.  Monticolo,  a  man
of  great  learning,  and  now  engaged  in  important  researches  on  Venetian
history,  of  which  the  results  will  soon  be  published.  Meanwhile  we  seize
this  occasion  to  express  our  thanks  in  print.

P.S. — We  may  now  add  that  Prof.  Monticolo  has  already  begun  to
ioublish  his  discoveries  in  "  Le  Fonti  della  Storia  d'italia,"  issued  by  the
Istituto  Storico  Italiano.

all  the  ensuing  facts,  although  beyond  the  reach  of  doubt,
would  remain  unexplained.

Therefore,  even  in  the  days  of  Countess  Matilda,  we
find  the  mass  of  the  citizens  divided  and  arranged  in
groups.  We  see  on  the  one  side  the  ancient  scholae
transformed  into  associations  of  arts  and  trades,  containing
X  the  germ  of  future  greater  and  lesser  guilds;  on  the  other,
family  associations  and  clans  of  the  grandi  or  leading
citizens,  embryos  of  future  societies  of  the  towers.  All
these  associations  already  formed  the  practical  government
of  the  city,  in  which  the  principal  offices  were  filled  by
grandi  of  Matilda's  choice.  It  is  quite  probable  that
the  post  of  preside  was  reserved,  in  accordance  with
mediaeval  usage,  to  a  single  family  or  clan,  perhaps  to
that  of  the  Uberti,  who  were,  as  we  shall  see,  among  the
most  powerful  in  the  city,  and  boasting  a  Germanic
descent.  Nevertheless,  there  was  then  no  hostility,  no
separation  between  the  great  folk  or  grandi  and  the
people,  all  being  united  by  common  bonds  and  interests.
In  fact,  as  we  have  said,  there  will  be  soon  documentary
evidence  that  some  of  the  grandi  engaged  in  commerce
were  chiefs  of  guilds,  and  already  beginning  to  fight,  side
by  side  with  the  people,  against  the  outlying  nobility.
It  is  true  that  they  owned  lands  and  herds,  but  these  were
then  the  main  source  of  that  Florentine  trade  and  com-
merce in  defence  of  which  the  first  wars  were  undertaken.
The  castles  surrounding  the  city  barred  all  outlets  for
commerce ;  armed  men  were  always  swooping  down  from
them  to  attack  and  maltreat  all  pack  trains  issuing  from
the  city  to  convey  its  products  and  merchandise  to  neigh-
bouring towns.     With  continual  wars  on  her  hands,  the

Countess  Matilda  could  seldom  afford  any  help,  and
consequently  the  Florentines,  although  fighting  in  her
name,  were  practically  left  to  their  own  resources.  It  was
this  alliance  of  all  classes  of  citizens,  united  by  identity
of  interests  and  singleness  of  purpose  against  a  common
foe,  that  then  constituted  the  strength  of  that  Florentine
people  whose  loyalty,  purity,  and  valour  were  so  fervently
praised  by  Dante  and  the  chroniclers.  This  was  the
moment  when  virtue  laid  the  foundations  of  the  Com-
mune's future  freedom  and  wealth.

Villani  is  given  to  exaggerate,  but  there  is  a  basis  of
truth  in  his  words  when  he  states  in  the  year  1107  (iv.
25)  that  "  the  city  being  much  risen  and  increased  in
population,  men,  and  power,  the  Florentines  determined
to  extend  their  outlying  contado^  and  widen  their  authority,
and  that  war  should  be  waged  against  any  castle  refusing
obedience."  This  year,  in  fact,  they  began  military
operations  by  attacking  the  fortress  of  Monte  Orlando,
near  Lastra  a  Signa,  also  described  by  the  chroniclers  as
the  castle  of  Gangalandi  or  Gualandi,  a  fief  of  the  Counts
Cadolingi,^  then  a  very  powerful  family,  and  soon  becom-
ing bitterly  hostile  to  Florence.  During  the  same  year
they  captured  and  demolished  the  stronghold  of  Prato,
owned  by  the  Counts  Alberti,  also  very  formidable
enemies.  But  as  on  this  occasion  the  Countess  was
present  in  the  camp,  their  success  is  more  easily  ex-
plained.2

year  mo;  but  is  recorded  in  the  Codex  Neap,  and  in  Tolomeo  da
Lucca.


I02     ORIGIN  OF  THE  FLORENTINE  COMMUNE.

In  I  no  we  hear  of  another  war.  *' Florentini  iuxsta
Pesa  comites  vicerunt,"  we  read  in  the  "  Annales,"  i.
which  start  with  this  event  and  date  it  the  26th  of  May.
The  comites  here  mentioned  cannot  be  the  Counts  Guidi,
then  on  friendly  terms  with  Matilda  and  Florence,  although,
when  fighting  against  both  at  a  much  later  date,  they
were  specially  designated  as  "The  Counts."  In  11 10
Florence  attacked  and  conquered  the  Cadolingi,  also
known  as  the  Cattani  Lombardiy  whose  lands  extended
from  Pistoia,  by  the  Val  di  Nievole,  towards  Lucca,  and
by  the  Lower  Val  d'Arno  to  the  vicinity  of  Florence.  If
the  city  could  rout  these  nobles,  it  must  have  acquired
great  strength,  even  admitting  the  probability  that  on
this  occasion  also  it  had  the  aid  of  Matilda's  troops.

In  1 1 1 3  there  were  two  other  military  campaigns
which,  owing  to  the  very  different  accounts  narrated  by
the  chroniclers,  have  given  rise  to  an  infinity  of  learned
disputes.  First  of  all  came  the  assault  and  destruction  of
Monte  Cascioli,  assigned  by  some  to  the  year  11 13,  by
others  to  1 1 14,  and  postponed  by  a  few  to  1 1 19,  when  it
was  supposed  to  have  been  defended  by  an  Imperial
German  vicar  named  Rempoctus  or  Rabodo,  who  perished
in  the  fight.  Other  chroniclers  assign  the  overthrow  of
the  castle  to  three  different  years,  and  Villani  puts  a
climax  to  the  confusion  by  jumbling  together  the  various
assaults  described,  assigning  them  all  to  11 13,  and  saying
that  the  castle  had  revolted  against  Robert  the  German,
vicar  of  the  Empire,  holding  residence  at  San  Miniato  al
Tedesco  (iv.  29).  But  in  1113 — that  is,  before  the
Countess's  death — there  was  no  Imperial  vicar  in  Tuscany,
and  consequently  none  could  be  installed  at  San  Miniato,
to  which  the  appellation  "  al  Tedesco "  was  not  yet
applied.  But  the  confusion  can  be  cleared,  the  chroniclers
made  to  agree,  and  the  different  narratives  easily  explained,
\f  it  is  admitted  that  only  the  first  attack  upon  Monte


PISAN  EXPEDITIONS.  .        I63

Cascioli  took  place  in  11 13,  when  the  castle  was  held  by
the  Cadolingi  and  could  be  vigorously  defended. ^  As
the  walls  on  that  occasion  were  only  partially  destroyed,  it
was  necessary  to  renew  the  assault  in  11 14,  when  they
were  totally  demolished.  They  were  afterwards  rebuilt
by  the  Cadolingi,  and  therefore,  in  11 19,  when  Florence
had  achieved  independence,  two  more  attempts  were  made
to  capture  the  stronghold  ;  the  Imperial  envoy  was  killed
while  assisting  in  its  defence,  and  the  building  was  finally
demolished  and  burnt  to  the  ground.  But  without  anti-
cipating events  we  may  conclude  that  even  before
Matilda's  death  the  Florentines  had  succeeded,  by  their
expeditions  against  Monte  Orlando,  Prato,  Val  di  Pesa,
and  Monte  Cascioli,  in  opening  the  highways  of  Signa,
PratOj  and  Val  d'Elsa  to  their  trade.

Another  event,  likewise  occurring  in  the  years  1 1 1 3-
15,  although  dated  by  the  chroniclers  in  1 1 17,  namely,  the
Pisan  expedition  to  the  Balearic  Isles,  also  led  to  a  some-
what complicated  dispute.  As  already  related,  the  Pisans
began  to  make  war  on  the  Mussulmans  from  the  middle
of  the  tenth  century,  and  during  the  latter  half  of  the
next  century  the  strife  was  pursued  more  hotly  than  ever.
In  1087  Pisa  and  Genoa  combined,  displayed  a  fleet  of
forty  sail  in  battle  array  before  Mehdia,  and  in  1 1 13  both
cities  joined  in  the  more  important  expedition  to  the
Balearic  Isles.  They  were  also  accompanied  by  many
counts  and  marquises  from  Lombardy  and  Central  Italy,
likewise  including   a  few  from  the  Florentine  territory.

'  The  "  Annales  fiorentini,"  ii.,  followed  by  Villani,  merely  relate  the
destruction  of  the  castle  in  11 13,  without  any  comments,  for  the  next
event  they  mention  relates  to  the  year  1135.  The  "Annales  fiorentini,"
i.,  say  nothing  about  it  in  11 13,  and  place  the  "  secunda  et  ultima  des-
truccio  murorum"  in  11 14.  In  11 19  they  record  two  other  attacks  on  the
castle,  "quem  marchio  Rempoctus  defendebat  "  :  by  the  second  of  which
the  Florentines  "  Monte  Cascioli  ignem  {sic)  consumpserunt."  It  seems
clear  that  three  attacks  were  made  in  succession,  and  farther  dispute  on
the  point  would  be  superfluous.


id4     ORIGIN  OF  THE  FLORENTINE  COMMUNE,

Then,  combining  with  the  Counts  of  Barcelona  and
Montpellier,  the  Viscount  of  Narbonne,  and  others,  they
attacked  the  Balearic  Isles,  and,  in  spite  of  a  very  obstinate
resistance,  seized  the  castle  of  Majorca,  and  captured
young  Burabe,  the  last  scion  of  the  ruling  dynasty  there.
Villani,  in  alluding  to  this  war  of  ii  13-15,  assigns  it,
like  the  other  chroniclers,  to  the  year  11 17,  adding  that
the  Pisans  fearing,  when  about  to  set  sail,  that  the
Lucchese  might,  as  once  before,  take  advantage  of  their
absence  to  attack  their  city,  entrusted  the  Florentines
with  its  defence.  The  latter  immediately  encamped  two
miles  from  the  walls  and  forbade  their  men  to  enter  Pisa,
under  penalty  of  death;  for,  seeing  that  scarcely  any  males
were  left  in  the  city,  they  feared  some  attempts  might  be
made  on  the  honour  of  its  women,  to  the  grave  discredit
of  Florentine  loyalty.  And  this  decree  was  rigorously
enforced.  One  soldier  who  dared  to  violate  the  rules  of
discipline  was  condemned  to  death,  notwithstanding  the
prayers  of  the  Pisans,  who,  as  the  only  chance  of  saving
the  man's  life,  protested  that  they  could  not  permit  a
capital  sentence  to  be  executed  on  their  territory.  Where-
upon the  Florentines,  shov/ing  even  in  this  matter  their
scrupulous  regard  for  othere'  rights,  purchased  a  scrap  of
land,  and  there  put  the  culprit  to  death.

Meanwhile,  the  Pisans  returning  from  Majorca,  laden
with  spoil,  offered  in  token  of  gratitude  to  their  faithful
friends  the  choice  of  accepting  either  two  bronze  doors
or  two  porphyry  columns.  The  Florentines  preferred  the
latter.  The  columns  were  consigned  to  them  wrapped  in
scarlet  cloth,  in  token  of  their  value,  and  now  stand  in
the  chief  portal  of  San  Giovanni.  However,  when  the
cloth  was  stripped  off,  it  was  seen  that  some  envious
person  had  injured  the  columns  with  fire.  Evidently  part
of  this  account  is  legendary,  and  we  also  discern  that
something  must  have  been  added  to  it  afterwards,  when


THE  BALEARIC  EXPEDITION.  105

Pisa  and  Florence  were  separated  by  long  and  inextin-
guishable animosity.  I

But  the  wrong  date  repeated  in  Villani  and  many  other
chroniclers,  regarding  a  war  that  lasted  several  years,  and  was
apparently  only  recommenced  in  1 1 17,  does  not  justify  us
in  denying  a  fact  so  constantly  afKrmed  by  many  writers. 2

'  The  "  Annales,"  i.  and  ii.,  omit  this  event.  The  Neap.  Codex
assigns  it,  as  does  Villani,  to  the  year  11 17,  but  only  says  that  the  Pisans
went  to  the  Balearic  Isles,  and  that  "  the  Florentines  guarded  the  city  of
Pisa"  (Hartwig,  ii.  272).  The  same  account  is  given  by  Tolomeo  da
Lucca,  but  he  dates  the  event  in  11 18;  so,  too,  the  pseudo  Brunclto
Latini,  who  records  the  gift  of  two  porphyry  columns,  "by  reason  that
the  Florentines  guarded  their  lands,  while  they  were  at  the  war,"  but
adds  nothing  more  to  this  statement.  As  to  the  error  of  date,  we  will
merely  remark  that  Capmany,  in  his  "  Memorias  historicas  sobra  la
marina  .  .  .  de  Barcelona,"  vol.  i.  p.  10,  after  narrating  the  expedition  of
1113-15,  goes  on  to  say  that  Raimondo  Berengario  III.  came  to  Pisa  and
Genoa  in  11 18,  in  order  to  promote  another  campaign.  Perhaps  the
remembrance  of  this  visit  contributed  to  the  mistake,  the  which,  once
made,  was  repeated  by  many  subsequent  writers.

'  Dr.  Hartwig  quotes  particulars  received  from  Dr.  Wiistenfeld  of  a
patent  dated  11 14,  which  would  seem  to  show  that  the  Florentines  also
took  part  in  the  expedition,  in  which  case,  he  observes,  the  columns
might  have  been  the  gift  of  the  Pisans,  and  nevertheless  part  of  the  spoil
taken  in  common.  I  caused  a  search  to  be  made  for  the  diploma  in  the
Pisan  Archives,  and  obtained  it  through  the  courtesy  of  Prof.  Lupi.
It  is  inserted  in  another  patent,  dated  vi.  idus  Augusti,  1233,  whereby
King  James  of  Aragon  confirms  the  Pisans  in  the  privileges  conferred  on
them  by  the  preceding  diploma  that  ''  Berengarius  Barchinione  glorio-
sissimus  Comes  Pisanis  fecit."  This  older  patent  is  reproduced  in  the
document,  and  bears  this  date  :  "  M.C.  quarto  decimo  .  .  .  septimo  idus
septembris,  indictione  sexta."  Although  several  other  words  stand
between  those  of  decimo  and  septimo,  this  mode  of  writing  the  date
may  have  been  another  cause  of  the  blunder  committed  by  the  chroni-
clers who  dated  the  event  in  11 17.

Whatever  may  be  thought  of  these  very  disputable  theories,  it  is
certain,  on  the  other  hand,  that  the  privileges  were  conferred  on  the
populo  pisano,  and  that  three  of  their  Consuls  were  invested  with  them,
and  received  "  vice  aliorum  Consulum  tociusque  pisani  populi,"  and  that
this  concession  was  made  "coram  marchionibus,  comitibus,  principibus
romanis,  lucensibus,  florentinis,  senensibus,  volterranis,  pistoriensibus,
longobardis,  sardis  et  corsis,  aliisque  innumerabilis  gentibus,  que  in
predicto  exercitu  aderant."  Therefore  it  was  no  mere  alliance  between
one  or  two  cities  :  it  was  the  Pisan  people  in  conjunction  with  many
potentates  from  different  parts  of  Italy.  The  chancellor  of  the  Pisan
Consuls  drew  up  the  diploma,  in  the  presence  of  the  Archbishop  of  Pisa,

The  Balearic  expedition  certainly  took  place,  and  there  is
equal  certainty  that  it  was  led  by  the  Pisans,  with  the  help
of  various  friends  and  allies.  Their  fear  lest  the  city
should  be  attacked  by  the  Lucchese  in  their  absence  was
justified  by  the  fact  that  this  had  really  happened  in
former  times.  The  Pisans  were  now  foes  of  Lucca  and
friends  of  Florence,  whose  loyalty  during  that  early  period
was  very  generally  recognised.  Why  should  it  be  in-
credible that  these  friendly  Pisans  should  have  entrusted
the  city  to  their  care,  or  that  they  should  have  proved
worthy  of  the  confidence  reposed  in  them.'*  Paolino
Pieri  not  only  repeats  the  story  as  told  by  all  the  other
chroniclers,  but  also  adds  that  the  bit  of  ground  upon
which  the  guilty  soldier  was  executed  had  been  purchased
with  the  help  of  Bello  the  Syndic,  and  that  even  in  his
own  day  he  saw  that  it  was  still  left  uncultivated  in
memory  of  the  deed  :  "  it  was  on  the  fourth  day  of  July,
three  hundred  and  two  years  more  than  one  thousand,
when  I  saw  that  ground  untouched."  At  any  rate,  this
is  a  proof  that  the  tradition  of  the  fact  still  survived  in
the  fourteenth  century,  and  that  every  one  had  the  fullest
belief  in  it.

VI.

The  death  of  Countess  Matilda,  in  1115,  was  followed
by  a  period  of  so  much  disorder  as  to  mark  the  beginning
of  a  new  era  for  all  Central  Italy,  and  more  especially
for  Florence.  The  countess,  as  we  know,  left  a  will
bequeathing  all  her  possessions  to  the  Church  ;  but  this

comites  and  nine  Consuls,  the  names  of  the  latter  being  given.  This
diploma  had  never  been  published  in  Italy  ;  therefore  Amari,  who  was
much  interested  in  the  subject,  wished  to  print,  just  before  his  decease,
the  copy  I  had  sent  him,  although  he  had  ascertained  that  it  was  already
published  in  Spain  by  Moragues  y  Bover  in  the  notes  to  a  "  Historia  de
Mallorca,"  by  Don  Vincente  Mut,  printed  at  Palma  in  1841.


IMPERIAL  AND  PAPAL  PRETENSIONS.         107

donation  could  only  afFect  her  allodial  estates,  since  all
those  held  in  fief  naturally  reverted  to  the  Empire.  It
was  not  always  easy  to  precisely  distinguish  these  from
those ;  often,  indeed,  impossible  :  hence  an  endless  suces-
sion  of  disputes.  And  such  disputes  became  increasingly
complicated  by  the  pretensions  of  the  Pope  and  the
emperor,  each  of  whom  asserted  his  right  to  the  whole
inheritance,  the  one  as  Matilda's  universal  legatee,  and  the
other  as  the  supreme  head  of  the  margraviate.  Then,
too,  as  we  have  seen,  many  considered  themselves  to  have
been  unjustly  deprived  of  their  estates,  in  favour  of  others
with  no  rightful  claim.  All  this  led  to  a  real  politico-social
crisis  that  brought  the  disorder  to  a  climax.  Thereupon
the  emperor,  Henry  IV.,  sent  a  representative,  bearing
the  title  of  MarchiOy  Index ^  Praeses,  to  assume  the  govern-
ment of  Tuscany  in  his  name.  Of  course,  no  one  could
legally  contest  his  right  to  do  this  ;  but  the  Papal  oppo-
sition, the  attitude  of  the  cities  now  asserting  their  inde-
pendence, and  the  general  disorder  split  the  margraviate
into  fragments.  Accordingly  the  representatives  of  the
Empire  could  only  place  themselves  at  the  head  of  the
feudal  nobility  of  the  various  contadi  and,  by  gathering
them  together,  form  a  Germanic  party  opposed  to  the
cities.  In  the  documents  of  the  period  the  members  of
this  party  arc  continually  designated  by  the  name  of
Teutons  (TeufonTci)J

Florence,  surrounded  by  the  castled  nobility  occupying
her  hills,  could  only  decide  on  one  of  two  courses.
Either  to  yield  to  those  who  had  always  been  her  mortal

enemies,  and  were  now  emboldened  by  Henry's  favour,  or
to  combat  them  openly,  and  thus  declare  enmity  to  the
Empire,  the  which,  in  the  preesnt  state  of  affairs,  would
amount  to  a  proclamation  of  independence  ;  and  the  latter
was  the  course  adopted.  Florence  was  now  conscious  of
her  own  strength,  and  recognised  that  safety  could  only
be  gained  by  force.  The  change  was  accomplished  in  a
very  simple  and  almost  imperceptible  way.  The  same
worthies  who  had  administered  justice,  governed  the
people,  and  commanded  the  garrison  in  Matilda's  name,
now  that  she  was  dead,  and  no  one  in  her  place,  continued
to  rule  in  the  name  of  the  people,  and  asked  its  advice  in
all  grave  emergencies.  Thus  these  grandi  became  Consuls
of  the  Commune  that  may  be  said  to  have  leapt  into
existence  unperceived.  This  is  why  no  chroniclers
mention  its  birth,  no  documents  record  it,  and  a  plain
and  self-evident  fact  is  made  to  appear  extremely  compli-
cated and  obscure.  In  endeavouring  to  discover  unknown
events  and  lost  documents  which  had  never  existed,  the
solution  of  a  very  easy  problem  was  hedged  round  with
difficulties,  while  evident  and  well-established  particulars
best  fitted  to  explain  it  were  entirely  lost  sight  of

Nevertheless,  we  are  not  to  believe  that  the  event  was
accomplished  without  any  shock,  for  the  change  was  of  a
very  remarkable  kind.  It  is  true  that  the  actual  govern-
ment remained  almost  intact ;  but  its  basis  was  altered,
since  it  was  now  carried  on  in  the  name  of  the  people,
instead  of  that  of  the  Countess.  This,  in  itself,  signified
little,  inasmuch  as  for  some  time  past  the  city  had  been
practically,  if  not  legally,  its  own  master,  and  the  people
beginning  to  feel  and  make  felt  its  personality.  But  the
social  and  political  results  of  the  change  were  neither  few
nor  inconsiderable.  Naturally,  during  Matilda's  reign,
the  governing  authorities  were  men  of  her  choice  ;  and
although  all  official  and  judicial  posts-changed  hands  from


FORMATION  OF  A  NEW  GOVERNMENT.       109

time  to  time,  they  became  increasingly  monopolised  by  a
small  cluster  of  families,  chief  among  whom,  as  we  have
already  said,  were  most  probably  the  Uberti  and  their
clan.  Now,  however,  that  the  authorities  were  to  be
elected  by  the  people,  there  was  a  broader,  although
still  somewhat  limited,  range  of  choice.  Accordingly,
there  was  more  change  of  office,  and  men  were  removed
in  turn  from  one  to  another.  This  custom  already  pre-
vailed in  other  communes,  and  had  been  adopted  even  in
Florence  both  by  popular  associations  and  those  of  the
grandi.  Hence  it  necessarily  prevailed  in  the  formation
of  the  new  government.

Nor  can  we  believe  that  those  always  to  the  front  in
former  times  could  have  now  withdrawn  without  resis-
tance, or  without  attempting  to  maintain  their  position
by  favour  of  the  Empire  and  the  Teutonici ;  nor  is  it
credible  that  those  now  entitled  to  a  larger  share  in  the
government  should  have  refrained  from  relying,  in  their
turn,  on  the  strength  of  the  popular  favour,  backed  by
the  most  vital  interests  of  the  city.  Friction  between  the
leading  families  seems  inevitable  to  us  in  this  state  of  things,
and  Florence  must  have  witnessed  some  such  conflict  as
at  Pisa  in  Daiberto's  day,  and  in  almost  all  other  Italian
communes.  We  learn  from  Villani  (v.  30),  from  the
"  Annales,"  and  many  other  works,  that  there  was  a  great
fire  in  Florence  in  11 15,  a  similar  one  in  11 17,  and  that
*'  what  was  left  unburned  in  the  first  fire  was  consumed
in  the  second."  It  was  certainly  an  exaggeration  to  say
that  the  whole  city  was  destroyed,  but  the  fact  of  the  fire
is  generally  affirmed.^      We  also  know  that  in  those  times,

'  The  "  Annales,"  i.,  record  two  fires  (11 15  and  11 17),  which  destroyed
the  whole  place  ;  the  Neap.  Codex  only  mentions  the  second.  Thomas
Tuscus,  writing  in  Florence  about  1279,  speaks  of  both  the  fires  in
his  "  Gesta  Imperatorum  et  Pontificum,"  attributing  to  that  cause  the
destruction  of  many  chronicles  which  he  supposes  to  have  existed,  but
which  probably  never  existed  at  all.     Villani  adopted  the  same  theory,


no     ORIGIN  OF  THE  FLORENTINE  COMMUNE.

before  gunpowder  was  invented,  fire  and  arson  were  thp
most  efficacious  weapons  in  popular  riots.  Villani  says^
farther,  that  "  fighting  went  on  among  the  citizens  .  .  \
sword  in  hand,  in  many  parts  of  Florence."  It  is  true,
that,  in  his  opinion,  the  fight  was /or  the  faith ^  seeing  that
the  city  being  given  over  to  heresy,  licence,  and  the  sect  of
the  Epicureans,  God  therefore  chastised  it  with  pestilence
and  civil  war.  But,  although  we  find  no  certain  traces  in
history  of  any  widely  difl^used  heresy  in  Florence  at  the
time,  it  is  undoubted  that  from  1068  the  earliest  gleams
of  Florentine  freedom  were  mixed  and  confused,  as  we
have  seen,  with  a  religious  movement,  and  it  is  also
certain  that  the  "  Annales,"  i.,  of  the  year  11 20  record
the  fact  of  one  named  Petrus  Mingardole  being  con-
demned for  heresy  to  the  ordeal  by  fire,i  and  also  add  that,
between  1138  and  1 173,  the  city  was  thrice  smitten  by
an  interdict,  all  of  which  goes  to  prove  a  continued
religious  agitation.  Besides,  Florence,  and  particularly
her  people,  remained  constantly  faithful  to  the  Church
party,  while  the  Uberti  and  their  adherents,  who  sided
with  the  Empire,  were  opposed  to  it,  and  consequently,
in  those  days,  may  have  easily  incurred  the  charge  of
heresy.  Even  in  Villani's  time  the  general  name  of
Paterini  was  bestowed  not  only  upon  all  heretics,  but  on
Ghibellines  as  well.2     Besides,  as  he  had  placed  the  origin

being  equally  unable  to  understand  that  the  Commune  might  have  had
no  historians  of  earlier  date.

'  Petrus  f.  Mingardole,  who,  "  ad  defendendum  se  de  crucifixo,"  passed
through  the  fire  unhurt.  Certain  historians,  unwilling  to  credit  the  exis-
tence of  heresy  in  Florence  at  that  time,  have  disputed  as  to  the  words
de  cructfixo,  and  proposed  this  reading  instead  :  cutn  crucifixo  or  de
crimine  infixo  But  the  facsimile  of  the  Codex,  published  by  Prof.
Paoli,  leaves  no  doubt  on  the  point.

In  fact,  Simone  della  Tosa,  a  later  chronicler,  who  may  have  copied
from  Villani  at  this  point,  after  relating  the  second  burning  of  the  city  in
1 1 17,  goes  on  to  say  that  "the  heresy  of  the  Paterini  was  then  abroad  in
P^lorence."  Pope  Innocent  III.  (1198-1216),  in  discoursing  on  heretics,
wrote  :    "  Impii    Manichaei  qui  se  Catharos  vel  Patercnos  appellant "


CIVIL  STRIFE.  Ill

of  Florence  before  Charlemagne's  day,  and  then  again
immediately  after  the  imaginary  destruction  of  Fiesole
in  loio,  he  naturally  refused  to  recognise  that  origin  for
the  third  time  at  the  moment  of  the  Commune's  real
birth.  Accordingly,  slurring  over  the  political  move-
ment, that  was  undoubtedly  the  main  factor  in  the
change,  he  tried  to  exaggerate  the  religious  movement
that  played  a  very  minor  part  in  it.

At  any  rate,  since  it  appears  certain  that  the  Uberti
asked  the  support  of  the  Empire,  they  must  have  been
now  necessarily  driven  to  prove  themselves  foes  of  the
Church.  Therefore,  it  cannot  have  been  unusual  for
them  to  be  styled  heretics  or  Pater ini^  especially  by  so
pronounced  a  Guelph  as  Villani.  We  know  that  the
Uberti  were  already  powerful  in  Matilda's  time,  from  the
frequent  appearance  of  their  name  in  contemporary  docu-
ments. That  they  also  enjoyed  a  lion's  share  of  the
government,  and  that  the  revolt  was  chiefly  directed
against  them,  is  explicitly  proved  by  the  words  of  a
chronicler — so  far  little  read,  we  might  almost  say  un-
known—whose work  being  derived  from  different  sources
than  that  of  Villani,  shows  some  events  in  a  new  light.
The  pseudo  Brunetto  Latini,  in  fact,  agrees  with  the
other  chroniclers  in  ascribing  the  first  fire  to  the  year
1 1 1 5,  saying  that  it  began  at  the  Santi  Apostoli,  and  spread
as  far  as  the  bishop's  palace,  "  whereby  the  greater  part  of
the  city  was  burnt,  and  many  folk  perished  in  the  flames."
He    says   nothing    concerning  heresy,   but   touching    the

(Ep.  lib.  X.  ep.  54,  in  Migne's  ed.  vol.  ii.  p.  1147).  Also,  in  the  "Annales
Camaldulenses  "  (vol.  iii.  app.  p.  396)  there  is  a  sentence  pronounced  at
Sutri,  in  1141,  running  as  follows  :  "  Igitur  universi  qui  vulgo  Paterenses
vocantur,  eo  quia,  sub  iugo  peccati,  retinebant  omnia  que  de  predicta
ecclesia  sancte  Fortunate  accipiebant."  Therefore  it  is  plain  that  the
name  of  Paterini  (although  strictly  speaking  that  of  a  special  sect,  quite
separate  from  others)  was  here  applied  to  all  those  occupying  Church
lands,  or  opposed  in  any  way  to  the  Church.  Hartwig^,  vol.  ii.  pp.  17
and  21.


112     ORIGIN  OF  THE  FLORENTINE  COMMUNE.

second  fire  of  1 1 17,  he  adds  :  "In  this  year  a  fire  broke
out  in  Florence  in  the  houses  of  the  Uberti,  who  ruled  the
city,  whereof  httle  was  saved  from  the  burning,  and  many
folk  perished  by  fire  and  sword."  ^  It  is  evident  that
there  was  a  real  outbreak,  almost  a  revolution  waged  with
fire  and  sword,  against  the  Uberti,  rulers  of  the  city.

Can  we  be  surprised  at  the  hatred  roused  by  the  Uberti,
or  at  the  civil  war  of  which  they  were  the  cause .?  As  we
know,  they  were  traditionally  supposed  to  have  come  with
the  Othos  from  Germany  ;  and  we  have  seen  how  the
legend  of  the  Libra  JiesolanOy  while  refiising  credence  to
this,  spoke  of  them  as  descended  from  "the  most  noble
race  of  Catiline,"  the  enemy  of  Florence.  Even  on
historical  evidence,  were  they  not  the  forefathers  of  those
Uberti,  who  afterwards,  in  1177,  proved  the  first  to
attack  the  Consular  government  and  begin  the  civil
warfare  by  which  the  city  was  so  long  torn  asunder  ^
Were  they  not  the  forefathers  of  the  Schiatta  Uberti,
ringleaders  of  the  band  that  stabbed  Buondelmonti  to
death,  by  the  statue  of  Mars  on  the  Ponte  Vecchio,  in
1 2 1 5  .f*  Were  they  not  the  ancestors  of  the  celebrated
Farinata,  who  routed  the  Guelphs  at  Montaperti,  and
attended  that  Council  of  Empoli  where  such  fierce
measures  were  proposed  against  Florence,  the  perpetual
nest  of  the  Guelphs — the  same  Farinata  described  by  Dante
among  the  heretics  in  the  bog  of  hell .?  2

'  Vide  the  Chronicle,  ad  annum.  As  we  have  already  observed,  all
information  regarding  this  period  is  derived  from  the  Gaddi  Codex,
discovered  in  the  Laurentian  Library  a  few  years  ago.  The  part
beginning  from  1181  is  also  contained  in  the  autograph  Chronicle  that
has  been  longer  known  to  us  ;  but  being  very  difficult  to  decipher  has
not  been  much  studied.

So  says  the  pseudo  Brunetto  Latini  in  the  year  1215.


DEMOLITION  OF  MONTE  CASCIOLI,  113

VII.

Meanwhile,  which  party  conquered  in  the  struggle
following  Matilda's  death  ?  Facts  prove  it  clearly
enough.  In  the  year  11 19  the  Florentines  made  that
Rnal  assault  on  the  castle  of  Monte  Cascioli,  to  which
-eference  has  been  already  made.  This  is  the  moment
when  the  before-mentioned  Rempoctus^^  or  Rabodo,  really
:omes  upon  the  scene,  although  Villani  (iv.  29)  and  other
:hroniclers  make  him  appear  in  11 13,  under  the  name  of
Robert  the  German,  Imperial  vicar,  and  suppose  him  to
lave  fallen  in  fight  that  year  while  defending  the  castle.
We  have  shown  that  there  could  be  no  Imperial  vicar  in
Tuscany  at  that  date,  seeing  that  none  was  sent  until
ifter  Matilda's  decease.  In  fact,  no  documents  mention
my  vicar  before  then,  and  only  on  September  11,  11 16,
NQ  find  one  recorded  as  "Rabodo  ex  largitione  Impera-
:oris  Marchio  Tuscia,"^  and  then  in  11 19,  "Rabodo  Dei
Tratia  si  quid  est,"  3  the  identical  formula  that  had  been
employed  in  Matilda's  patents.  In  11 20  Rabodo's  name
disappears,  and  is  replaced  by  that  of  the  Margrave
Corrado.  It  may  therefore  be  taken  for  granted  that
Rabodo  really  perished  in  1 1 1 9  during  the  defence  of
Monte  Cascioli  against  the  Florentines,  who  now  suc-
:eeded  in  finally  demolishing  the  stronghold  and  burn-
ing  it  to  the  ground.4      Thus   their   first   achievement,

this  would  be  nonsense.  Lami  proposed  the  reading,  des  auctoritate^
but  this  too  would  lack  sense.  The  interpretation  preferred  and  adopted
by  ourselves  was  suggested  by  Prof.  Paoli.  In  combating  the  Empire
and  fighting  for  the  Church,  the  Florentines  believed  themselves
to  be  under  Divine  protection,  and  considering  their  adversaries  as
enemies  of  God,  accordingly  named  them  heretics  and  Paterini.

114    ORIGIN  OF  THE  FLORENTINE  COMMUNE.

after  Matilda's  decease,  was  the  destruction  of  a
Cadolingi  castle,  together  with  the  defeat  and  death  in
battle  of  the  first  Imperial  vicar  then  established  in
Tuscany.  This  is  more  than  enough  to  show  the  nature
of  their  attitude  with  regard  to  the  Empire  and  the
Teutonic  party.

Shortly  after,  an  event  of  even  greater  significance
occurred  in  the  capture  and  sack  of  Fiesole  during  1125.
Sanzanome,  whose  so-called  modern  history  of  Florence
starts  with  this  war,  describes  it  at  much  length,  in  flights
of  wordy  rhetoric.  The  gist  of  it  is  that  the  chief  cause
of  the  conflict  was  a  commercial  dispute.  The  people  of
Fiesole  would  seem  to  have  maltreated  and  plundered  a
Florentine  trader  who  was  quietly  passing  through  the
city  with  his  goods.  This  incident,  added  to  the  remem-
brance of  past  rancours  and  other  recent  depredations,  seems
to  have  stirred  the  Florentines  to  war.  Instantly,  "factum
est  Consilium  per  tunc  dominantes  Consules  de  processu."
One  of  the  leading  citizens  harangued  the  people,  beginning
his  speech  with  these  words  :  "  Si  de  nobili  Romanorum
prosapia  originem  duximus  .  .  .  decet  nos  patrum  adherere
vestigiis."  Thereupon,  "  illico  a  Consulibus  exivit  edic-
tum."  A  man  of  Fiesole,  on  the  other  hand,  began  his
address  by  alluding  to  the  legendary  origin  of  his  city  :
"  Viri,  frates,  qui  ab  Ytalo  sumpsistis  originem,  a  quo  tota
Ytalia  dicitur  esse  derivata."  Although  so  much  learned
rhetoric  in  a  writer  of  the  early  part  of  the  thirteenth
century  is  another  proof  of  the  strong  influence  of  Roman
tradition  on  ancient  Florentines,  both  before  and  after  the
rise  of  their  Commune,  it  cannot  conceal  the  real  cause  of
the  war,  as  proved  even  by  the  evidence  of  Villani,  whose
chronicle  begins  to  acquire  greater  historic  value  at  this
point.  The  latter  relates  that  Fiesole  had  become  a
veritable  nest  of  Cattani  and  brigands,  who  infested  the


DESTRUCTION  OF  FIESOLE.  115

Florentine  highways  and  territories.  ^  As  usual,  the  feudal
barons  were  swooping  down  from  their  strongholds  to
hinder  the  trade  and  traffic  of  the  Commune.

At  this  moment  also  there  were  special  causes  tending
to  provoke  a  war  of  an  unusually  sanguinary  kind.  The
counties,  or  contadi^  of  the  two  cities,  as  sometimes
occurred  elsewhere,  had  been  carved  out  of  the  territories
of  bishoprics,  based,  in  their  turn,  on  ancient  Roman
partitions  of  the  soil.  Accordingly,  these  counties  being
not  only  adjacent,  but  wedged  in  and  almost  tangled  one
with  the  other,  and  their  respective  bishops  having  never
wielded,  as  in  Lombard y,  the  authority  or  power  of
counts  they  had  ended  by  forming  a  single,  combined
jurisdiction.  In  fact,  many  documents  refer  to  the  county
Dr  jurisdiction  of  Fiesole  and  Florence,  as  though  it  were
Dne  and  the  same  thing.  Hence  it  was  only  natural  that  on
becoming  an  independent  Commune,  after  Matilda's  death,
Florence  should  seek  to  dominate  over  both  counties,  and
squally  natural  that  Fiesole  should  be  violently  opposed
to  the  idea,  and,  notwithstanding  the  inferior  size  of  the
town,  should  have  trusted  to  the  superior  strength  of  its
Fortified  position,  and,  making  alliance  with  the  nobles  of
:he  contado,  should  have  harboured  them  in  the  citadel,
ind  joined  them  in  continual  attacks  on  Florentine  traders
Dr  in  raiding  Florentine  lands.  This  was  the  beginning
Df  the  war.  Its  details  are  unknown  to  us,  those  supplied
by  Sanzanome  being  too  extravagant  for  belief,^  and  other
:hroniclers  furnishing  none  at  all.  Seeing  the  strength  of
Fiesole's  position,  the  campaign  could  have  been  neither

*  "Teneanla  certi  gentiluomini  Cattani,  stati  della  citth.  di  Fiesole,
;  dentro  vi  si  riducevano  masnadieri  e  sbanditi  e  mala  gente,  che  alcuna
foXia.  faceano  danno  alle  strade  e  al  contado  di  Firenze  "  (iv.  32).

"^  According  to  the  "Annales,"  i.,  the  war  lasted  less  than  three
nonths,  while  Sanzanome  stretches  it  to  three  years.  Possibly  the
atter  included  all  the  attacks  and  skirmishes  by  which  the  war  may
lave  been  prefaced.


ii6     ORIGIN  OF  THE  FLORENTINE  COMMUNE.

short  nor  easy,  and  undoubtedly  ended  in  cruel  slaughter  and
the  almost  total  destruction  of  the  town.  The  chroniclers
are  not  the  only  authorities  for  this  fact.  Shortly  afterwards,
the  Abbot  Atto  of  Vallombrosa  implored  a  pardon  from
Pope  Honorius  II.,  -pro  Florentimrum  excessibus^  urging
in  their  favour  that  there  were  many  aged  persons,  women,
and  children,  in  Florence,  who  had  assuredly  taken  no
part  in  the  destruccio  fesulana^  and  also  that  many  partici-
pants in  the  war  now  confessed  the  error  of  their  ways,
and  sincerely  repented  all  the  excesses  that  '*  non  meditata
nequitia  commisere.''^  The  event  was  long  remembered
in  Florence,  is  frequently  recorded  in  documents,^  and,
together  with  the  rout  of  the  Imperial  vicar  at  Monte
Cascioli,  undoubtedly  contributed  to  establish  the  inde-
pendence of  the  Commune  on  a  firmer  basis.


VIII.

It  is  certain  that  Florence  now  had  a  separate  govern-
ment under  Consuls  of  her  own,  although  there  is  no
documentary  proof  to  this  effect  earlier  than  1138.
Sanzanome,  however,  makes  explicit  allusion  to  it  at  the
time  of  the  Fiesole  campaign,  when,  as  we  have  seen,  war
was  declared  by  the  Consuls.  But  what  was  the  real
nature  and  origin  of  this  new  magistracy }  Formerly  it
was  opined  by  many  writers  that  the  Consuls  were  an
institution  derived  in  general  from  the  judges  of  older
days.  In  Lombardy  they  would  have  been  merely
another  form  of  the  Frankish  scabini^  and  accordingly

*  Soldani,  "  Historia  Monasterii  S.  Michaelis  de  Passiniano,"  p.  109,
quoted  by  Lami,  "Lezioni,"  i.  288.

*  In  Passerini's  collection  of  documents,  quoted  above,  one  finds,
at  p.  211,  the  following  words:  "Domina  Sofia  dixit  et  dicit  quod  est
Ixxx.  annorum  et  plus,  et  recordatur  de  destructione  Fesularum.''
Others  give  testimony  to  the  same  effect.


THE  CONSULAR  GOVERNMENT.  117

in  Florence  it  was  natural  to  suppose  them  to  be  an
altered  survival  of  those  judges  of  the  margravial
tribunal  to  whom,  for  some  time  before  her  death,
Matilda  had  accorded  the  right  to  give  sentence.  But
this  view  can  be  no  longer  maintained,  since  it  does  not
comprise  the  whole  truth  of  the  matter.  For  even  when
the  Consuls  are  seen  in  the  exercise  of  their  functions,
what  are  they,  what  do  they  do,  according  to  chronicles
and  documents  }  They  conduct  wars,  conclude  treaties
in  the  name  of  the  people,  of  whom  they  are  the  represen-
tatives ;  they  govern  the  city  ;  they  administer  justice.
And  at  Florence,  as  elsewhere,  the  latter  is  only  one  of
their  duties,  and  only  undertaken  by  them  because  so
closely  connected  with  the  exercise  of  the  political  power
that  is,  above  all,  their  genuine  and  principal  function.
Besides,  what  was  it  that  really  led  to  the  birth  of  the
Florentine  Commune }  What  save  the  lack  of  the
higher  political  authority  hitherto  ruling  Tuscany,  and
the  necessity  of  making  war  against  old  and  new  foes  !
Accordingly  the  military  and  political  elements  unavoid-
ably prevailed.

We  are  further  confirmed  in  this  idea  by  examining  the
constitution  of  the  Consular  bench.  At  first  it  would  seem
that  all  or  some  of  the  Consuls  presided  without  distinc-
tion, while  later,  three  members  were  chosen  in  turn,  and
entitled  Consules  super  facto  iustitiae,  or  even  Consules  de
iustitia^  to  preside  for  one  month  ;  at  a  still  later  date
two  Consuls  presided  for  a  term  of  two  months,  and
finally,  after  the  nature  of  the  primitive  government  has
been  changed,  we  find  a  single  Consul  acting  as  president
throughout  a  whole  year.^

'  In  a  sentence  given  on  December  30,  1172,  we  find  seven  Consuls
named,  a  judge  in  ordinary,  and  three  proveditors.  The  Consuls  instal
the  judge,  "  huic  missioni  in  possessum  auctoritatem  prestans."  This
document  and  many  similar  ones  are  in  the  Florence  Archives,  Curia
di  S.  Michele.     Some  have  been  printed  separately  by  Prof.  Santini,  in


£i8     ORIGIN  OF  THE  FLORENTINE  COMMUNE.

They  might  be,  but  were  not  necessarily,  legal  experts,
since  they  only  pronounced  and  confirmed  the  judgment
decided  upon  without  either  preparing  or  formulating  it.
This  duty  fell  to  a  real  index  ordinarius  pro  Comune,
together  with  three  proveditors  or  provisores^  who
examined  the  case  and  wrote  the  sentence.  The  Consuls
merely  sat  as  presidents  of  the  tribunal,  and  when,  as
sometimes  occurred,  they  failed  to  appear,  the  tribunal
acted  on  its  own  account.  Therefore  their  office  was
practically  the  same  as  that  of  Countess  Matilda  herself —
/.<?.,  to  represent  sovereignty  without  filling  the  place  of
judges.  I

The  real  nature  of  the  new  government  will  be  best
understood  after  investigating  the  different  elements   of

pt.  ii.  of  a  volume  soon,  we  hope,  to  be  given  to  the  world.  We  call
the  reader's  attention  to  the  fact  that  we  quote  from  his  work  not  only
with  regard  to  documents  which  are  still  inedited,  but  also  touching
those  already  edited  by  other  writers,  because  we  know  that  he  has
carefully  collated  all  with  their  originals.  In  his  forthcoming  work  he
will  probably  indicate  which  documents  were  discovered  by  himself,
which  simply  reproduced.  Vide  Santini,  pt.  ii.  doc.  i.  In  October,
1181,  three  Consuls  preside  "super  facto  iustitiae,  nominatim  in  mense
octobris."  The  judge  Restauransdampnum  confirms  the  sentence  (ibid.,
doc.  ii.).  There  are  other  documents  to  the  same  effect,  though  we  also
sometimes  find  two  Consuls  for  one  month.  On  January  27,  1197,  there
are  two  Consuls  of  justice  for  January  and  February  (Santini,  pt.  ii.
doc.  ix.),  and  so  on  for  some  time,  two  Consuls  for  two  months.  On
February  28,  1 198,  the  two  Consuls  are  judges  by  profession  ;  but,  never-
theless, the  assistance  of  a  judge  in  ordinary — one  Spinello  Spada — is  still
required  (ibid.,  doc.  x.).  This  is  an  additional  proof  that  the  Consuls  of
justice  did  not  exactly  fulfil  the  function  of  real  judges.  From  1201
downwards  we  find  one  Consul  of  justice  per  totum  annum  (ibid.,  docs,
xiii.,  XV.).

'  On  April  18,  1201— there  being  then  a  Potest — we  only  find
"  Gerardus  ordinarium  index  cognitor  controversiae  .  .  .  banc  senten-
tiam  tuli  ideoque  subscripsi,''  without  a  Consul  of  justice,  who  reappears
soon  afterwards  (Santini,  pt.  ii.  doc.  xi).  It  would  seem  that  at  Pisa
it  was  the  rule  to  nominate  special  judges,  electi,  or  dati  a  Consulibus  et
universo  pofiulo,  who  pronounced  judgment  on  their  own  account,  some-
times in  the  presence  of  the  Consuls.  Elsewhere  we  find  Consoles  de
placitis,  or  Assessores  Consulum  (as  at  Parma,  for  instance),  who  pro-
nounced judgment  without  the  intervention  of  the  Copsuls  of  the  Corrj-
piune  (Ficker,  iii.  pars.  584  and  585).


NOBLES  AND  PEOPLE.  ii^

the  civic  body  from  which  that  government  was  neces-
sarily evolved.  As  we  are  aware,  there  were  two  leading
classes  and  interests  dividing  the  city  between  them — that
is,  the  trade  guilds,  and  the  associations  of  worthies,  or
of  the  Towers.  In  numerical  strength  the  people  had
greatly  the  advantage  ;  but  the  worthies  {grandt)  were
far  more  cultivated,  trained  to  arms  and  politics,  and
already  somewhat  versed  in  the  art  of  government.
Therefore,  the  Consuls  were  recruited  from  this  class,  and
at  first  always  chosen  from  so  small  a  number  of  families,
that  the  office  appeared  to  be  almost  an  hereditary  one.
The  misfortune  of  Florence,  as  indeed  of  all  the  other  com-
munes, Venice  excepted,  was  that  the  grandi  were  never
agreed  among  themselves.  Feudal  nobility  in  Italy
resembled  an  exotic  plant  transferred  to  uncongenial  soil.
Elsewhere,  being  of  German  origin,  it  formed  part  of  an
entire  political  system  ;  it  was  under  the  orders  of  the
emperor  to  whom  it  adhered  ;  it  had  certain  heroic
qualities  ;  it  created  a  special  form  of  civilisation,  and  a
literature  that  flourished  in  France  and  Germany,  but  it
never  throve  in  Italy,  and  in  Tuscany  least  of  all.  Our
feudal  lords,  being  solely  dominated  by  personal  interests,
leant  on  the  Empire,  the  better  to  combat  the  Pope  ;  on
the  Pope,  to  combat  the  Empire ;  on  the  one  or  the  other
indiscriminately  to  combat  the  cities.  Even  on  Floren-
tine territory  the  same  thing  continually  occurred.  The
grandi  established  within  the  city  walls  were,  it  is  true,
of  a  very  different  temper,  and  much  nearer  to  the  people,
whose  life  they  shared  ;  but  they  comprised  very  dis-
cordant elements  ;  for  whereas  some  of  these  grandi  had
risen  from  the  people,  others  were  descended  from  feudal
houses,  with  whom  they  maintained  friendly  relations  and
on  whose  aid  they  could  rely.  Thirst  for  power  was  a
speedy  cause  of  division  among  them,  and  the  ease  with
which  one  party  gained  favour  with  the  working  classes,


120     ORIGIN  OF  THE  FLORENTINE  COMMUNE.

while  the  other  was  backed  by  the  nobles  of  the  contado^
fostered  the  growth  of  civil  strife.  Then,  later  on,  as
more  nobles  deserted  their  castles  for  the  city,  a  regularly
aristocratic  and  Ghibelline  party  was  formed  in  opposition
to  the  Guelph  and  popular  side.  This  point,  however,  was
still  far  removed,  for  the  common  necessity  of  making
head  against  the  baronage  of  the  contado  long  prevailed
over  all  other  interests,  since  the  very  life  of  the  Commune
was  involved  in  that  struggle.

All  that  we  have  so  far  related  serves  to  show  with  in-
creasing clearness  that  two  quite  distinct  classes  of  citizens
already  existed  in  Florence — namely,  that  of  the  people  or
trades  {arti),  and  that  of  the  worthies  {grandi).  Had
the  new  government  been  evolved  from  the  trades  alone,
it  would  have  assumed  a  form  constituted  on  the  basis
of  a  trade  guild.  Had  it  issued  from  the  grandi  alone,
it  would  have  given  rise  to  a  regional  and  local  constitu-
tion, corresponding  with  the  sestieri  of  the  city  over  which
their  abodes  were  scattered.  In  all  Italian  communes  this
double  tendency  is  to  be  found.  In  Rome  the  constitu-
tion by  districts,  or  rioni^  prevailed  ;  while  at  Florence,
after  a  time,  the  constitution  by  guilds  obtained  in  con-
sequence of  the  enormous  prosperity  of  commerce  and
industry  in  that  city.  Meanwhile,  however,  the  moral
predominance  of  the  grandi  and  the  pressing  exigencies
of  war  favoured  a  division  of  the  city  in  sestieri.,  whereby
the  first  assembling  and  organising  of  the  army  was  greatly
facilitated.  It  was  for  this  reason  that  the  Consuls  were
elected  by  their  respective  sestieri.^  That  the  grandi
were   already   organised   in   *'  Societies  of   the    Towers "

_ '  Originally,  Florence  was  divided  in  quarters  {quartieri).  The  old
city  did  not  then  comprise  the  part  beyond  the  Arno,  Oltrarno,  which
was  only  inhabited  by  a  few  "low  folk  of  small  account"  (Villani,  iv.
14).  Afterwards,  but  from  the  earliest  days  of  the  Commune,  the  city  was
arranged  in  sestieri,  of  which  the  Oltrarno  formed  one.  In  the  year
1343  (Villani,  xii.  18)  the  division  in  four  quarters  was  resumed.


SOCIETIES  OF  THE  TOWERS  121

there  is  written  evidence  to  prove.  A  document  of  1165
alludes  to  these  societies  as  having  been  in  existence  for
some  time/  and  the  parchments  of  the  Florence  Archives
comprise  actual  fragments  of  their  statutes  dated  only  a
few  years  later  on. 2  The  "  Tower  "  was  possessed  in
common  by  the  partners  or  associates,  and  no  share  in  it
could  be  bequeathed  to  any  one  outside  the  society,  or
to  any  member  elected  by  less  than  all  votes  save  one.
Women  were  naturally  excluded.  The  expense  of  main-
taining and  fortifying  the  Tower,  which  always  communi-
cated with  the  houses  of  neighbouring  members,  and
served  for  their  common  defence,  was  divided  among
them  all.  Three  or  more  rectors,  also  sometimes  called
Consuls,  managed  the  society,  settled  disputes,  and  named
their  own  successors.  These  rectors  and  their  com-
panions are  the  men  we  now  find  at  the  head  of  the
government  ;  and  there  is  clear  documentary  evidence  that
the  Consuls  of  the  Commune  were  almost  invariably  chosen
from  families  belonging  to  the  Societies  of  the  Towers.
When,  too,  we  observe  that  some  of  them  were  occasion-
ally nominated  Consuls  of  the  guilds,3  as  Cavalcanti,  for

Archives  (S.  Appendix  ii.  doc.  i.  p.  517).  It  is  an  act  of  donation,  giving
part  of  a  house  to  the  members  of  the  Societa  della  Torre  of  Capo  di
Ponte :  "  Tarn  qui  modo  sunt,  aut  in  antea  fuerunt  ex  Societate  vestre

older  period,  in  the  Florence  Archives.  The  Statute  of  the  Podesth
(in  1324)  also  mentions  the  Societies  of  the  Towers.  The  whole  question
has  been  minutely  studied  by  Prof.  Santini  in  his  learned  work  on
the  "  Societh.  delle  Torri  in  Firenze,"  first  published  in  the  "Arch.
Stor.  It.,"  Series  iv.  t.  xx.  1887,  and  subsequently  in  a  separate  form.  In
Appendix  ii.  of  his  previously  quoted  work  the  author  includes  several
documents  relating  to  these  societies.  They  are  respectively  dated
1165,  1179,  1180,  1181,  1183,  1201,  1209,  &c.

mentary evidence.


122     ORIGIN  OF  THE  FLORENTINE  COMMUNE,

example,  and  several  others,  we  gain  an  undoubted  proof
of  the  friendly  terms  preserved,  as  w^e  have  previously-
noted,  betv^een  these  nobles  and  the  people.  The
societies  were  organised  somewhat  after  the  fashion  of  the
guilds,  by  which  they  may  have  been  originally  inspired,
and  were  not  on  a  strictly  feudal  basis.  ^

Had  the  more  aristocratic  Uberti  achieved  sole  pre-
dominance in  the  city,  things  would  have  assuredly
taken  a  different  turn  ;  but  these  patricians  were  com-
pelled, although  reluctantly,  to  yield  to  the  force  of
events  frequently  opposed  to  their  views.  In  fact,  they
were  seldom  Consuls  before  the  year  1177.  when,  after
exciting  a  genuine  revolution,  they  were  more  frequently
named  to  that  post.  This  confirms  the  fact  of  their
previous  defeat  in  11 15.  The  consular  government  had
then  fallen  into  the  hands  of  several  noble  families  on
good  terms  with  the  people.  And  it  was  the  popular
voice  that  prevailed  in  the  assemblies  where  all  the  chief
questions  and  interests  of  the  State  were  decided.

The  Consuls  2  were  elected  at  the  beginning  of  the  year,
two  for  each  sestieri.  At  least,  this  seems  to  have  been
the  ordinary  number,  although  we  cannot  be  quite  certain,

'  On  this  point  I  differ  from  Santini.  The  rural  societies  he  has  been
able  to  discover  are  few  in  number,  of  a  different  nature  from  the  others,
and  of  less  ancient  date.  Out  in  the  country  the  principal  basis  of  the
society  was  lacking — i.e.,  the  tower  surrounded  by  houses  belonging  to
different  members.

*  Villani  (v.  32)  also  tells  us  that  Florence  was  under  "the  rule  of
Consuls  chosen  from  the  greatest  and  best  of  the  city,  with  a  council  of
the  senate,  that  is  of  one  hundred  worthies,  and  that,  as  in  Rome,  all
these  Consuls  "  guided  and  governed  the  city,  holding  office  for  one  year."
He  arbitrarily  fixes  their  number  at  four  or  six,  according  to  the  division
of  the  city  in  quarters  or  sixths,  and  adds  that,  whenever  mentioned,  only
the  chief  Consul  was  named.  January  seems  to  have  been  the  time  fixed
for  the  election.  In  1202  we  find  the  same  Consuls  in  the  first  and  second
half  of  the  year  (March  i  and  October  1).  This  would  likewise  prove
that  the  year  was  not  then  begun  on  the  25th  of  March,  according  to
Florentine  style  (Santini,  doc.  v.).  In  Sienna,  January  was  the  time  ot  the
election,  and  on  the  evidence  of  the  chroniclers  one  may  infer  that  it  was
the  same  in  Florence..


MODE  OF  ELECrmC  THE  CONSULS.  123

since  the  number  was  not  invariably  the  same.  Two  of
the  twelve,  chosen  in  rotation,  acted  as  heads  of  the
college,  and  were  styled  Consules  priores.  For  this  reason
the  chroniclers  only  mentioned  two  Consuls  as  a  rule,  and
sometimes  one  alone.  In  documents  two,  three,  or  even
more  are  mentioned,  but  always  as  representing  the  rest
of  their  colleagues,  whose  names  are  often  added.  Most
rarely  and  only  at  exceptional  moments  do  we  find  record
of  a  higher  number  than  twelve.  ^  Then  perhaps  because
the  retiring  Consuls  continued  in  office  with  the  new  ones
for  a  few  days,  or  fi'om  some  other  passing  cause  that  is
unknown  to  us.  Such  variations  are  not  surprising  if  it
is  kept  in  mind  that  the  constitution  of  Florence,  being
then  in  course  of  formation,  must  have  been  liable  to
uncertainty  and  change,  as  will  often  be  seen  further  on.


•  The  first  document  recording  the  names  of  consuls  is  dated  March  19,
1 1 38  (quoted  by  Hartwig,  ii.  185,  from  the  "  Memorie  di  Lucca,"  vol.  iv.  p.
173,  doc.  122),  and  states  that  " Broccardus  et  Selvor^s^'  promise  '"'■proseet
pro  sociis  suis."  The  second  is  dated  June  4, 1 138  (Santini,  pt.  i.  doc.  ii.),
and  in  this  a  Count  Ugicio  (or  Egicio)  receives  "launechild  et  meritum  a
Burello  et  Florenzito  Consulibus,  vice  totius  populi."  These  two  docu-
ments of  the  same  year  do  not  contain  identical  names,  perhaps  because
they  only  give  those  of  the  Consules  priores,  who  sat  in  turn,  as  we  have
before  remarked.  Even  in  Sienna  the  Consules  priores  seem  to  have
been  continually  changed.  Vide  Caleffo  Vecchio  for  June,  August,
October,  1202  ;  Caleffo  dell'  Assunta,  1202.  And  when  Consuls  were
replaced  by  Governors,  each  of  these  was  Prior  for  one  week.

In  two  Florentine  documents,  among  the  Capitoli,  dated  April  7,  1174,
and  April  4,  1 176  (Santini,  pt.  i.  docs.  vi.  and  ix.),  all  the  Consuls — ten  in
number — are  named,  possibly  the  Consuls  of  justice  being  omitted.  But,
on  the  other  hand,  in  an  oath  sworn  by  the  men  of  Mangona  to  Florence
(October  28,  1184,  in  Santini,  pt.  i.  doc.  xv.)  we  read:  "Annualiter
dabimus  unam  albergariam  xij.  Consulibus  Florentie."  Even  in  1204  we
find  twelve  ;  but  more  than  twelve  are  recorded  in  the  documents  of  the
League  (i  197-8),  and  likewise  in  the  year  1203.  We  have  already  given
the  probable  explanation  of  this  fact.  The  Consules  priores,  also  existing
in  other  communes,  are  seldom  mentioned  in  Florence  by  the  name  of
Priores,  especially  in  early  days.  But  there  is  one  doc.  dated  October  24,
and  November  7,  1204  (S.  pt.  i.  doc.  liii.)  saying  :  "  Potestas  Florentie
vel  Consules  eiusdem  civitatis,  omnes  vel  maior  pars  vel  Priores  aut  Prior
eorum."     So^  too,  another  document  dated  October  15,  1200.


124     ORIGIN  OF  THE  FLORENTINE  COMMUNE.

IX.

Attention  should  now  be  called  to  the  popular  element  in
the  constitution.  That  the  guilds  were  solidly  established  by
the  early  part  of  the  twelfth  century  is  indubitably  proved.
Villani  says  that  towards  the  year  1150  the  Consuls  of  the
Merchants,  or  rather  of  the  "  Calimala  Guild,"  were  entrusted
by  the  Commune  of  Florence  with  the  building  works  of
San  Giovanni "  (i.  60).  Of  still  greater  significance  is
the  fact  that  on  February  3,  1 182,  the  men  of  Empoli,  in
making  submission  to  Florence,  were  bound  to  make  a
yearly  payment  of  fifty  pounds  of  "  good  money  "  {buoni
denari)  to  the  Consuls  or  Rectors  of  the  city,  and,  failing
these  officials,  to  the  Consuls  of  the  Merchants,  ^  as  repre-
senting the  Commune.  Now,  if  these  Consuls  had  reached
so  high  a  degree  of  importance  in  1 1 8  2,  we  are  entitled
to  believe  that  the  guild  was  of  no  recent  origin.  And
remembering  that  the  guild  in  question  was  the  Calimala—
i.f.,  that  of  finishers  and  dyers  of  woollen  cloths  manufac-
tured abroad,  and  more  especially  in  Flanders,  imported
by  Florence,  and  thence  despatched  to  foreign  markets —
we  shall  understand  that  Florentine  commerce  must  have
already  attained  a  prodigious  development,  and  conse-
quently that  many  of  the  guilds  must  have  been  already
long  established.  A  solitary  instance  would  naturally
afford  little  proof,  since  it  might  be  open  to  various
interpretations  ;  but  others  can  be  adduced  to  the  same
effect.  In  a  treaty  between  Lucca  and  Florence  of  July
21,  1 1 84,  we  find  a  stipulation  according  to  which  the
terms  might  be  modified  by  the  Florentine  Consuls
comuni  populo  electi^  and  by  twenty-five  counsellors,
provided,  as  was  expressly  declared,  the  Consuls  of  the
merchants  were    comprised  in  the  number  2      Likewise,

*  Santini,  pt.  i.  doc.  xii.  '  Ibid.,  pt.  i.  doc  xv.


MUTABILITY  OF  THE  GOVERNMENT  125

when  the  men  of  Trebbio  made  submission  on  July  14,
1 193,  the  power  of  incorporating  the  agreement  in  the
City  Statutes  was  exclusively  reserved  to  the  seven  Rec-
tor es  qui  sunt  super  Capitibus  Artium.^

But  a  final  observation  occurs  to  us  at  this  point,  again
showing  the  very  uncertain  and  changeable  nature  of  this
consular  government.  In  mentioning  the  chief  authorities
of  the  Commune,  almost  all  documents  refer  to  them  as
*'  Consules  seu  rectores  vel  rector^'  with  the  addition,  at  a
later  date,  of  "  Potestas  sive  dominator."'^  All  these  terms
had  a  very  general  meaning  at  the  period.  Nevertheless,
there  must  have  been  some  reason  for  employing  the
formula — Consuls  or  Rectors  or  Potesta — in  treaties  of
peace,  or  alliance,  or  state  documents  of  high  importance ;
and  probably  a  special  reason,  seeing  that  we  often  find
the  formula  ending  as  follows  :  "  Consules  qui  pro  tempore
erint^  et  si  non  erint^'  the  Rectors  or  the  Potesta  or  the
Consuls  of  the  guilds  were  to  act  in  their  stead.  Why  so
much  vagueness  in  indicating  the  chief  magistrate  of  the
Republic  ,?  Only  one  explanation  is  possible.  The  real
practical  government  of  the  city  was  carried  on  by  the
various  associations  ;  the  office  of  Consul  had  (qw  attri-
butes and  never  attained  the  power  and  importance  due  to
a  central  government,  as  conceived  in  the  modern  sense.
The  same  remark  may  be  also  applied  to  the  Priors,  the

'  There  were,  in  fact,  Consuls  of  the  Commune,  of  the  guilds,  of  the  Arno,
of  the  city  gates,  of  the  Societies  of  the  Towers,  and  the  latter  were  more
specially  styled  Rectors.  Yet  even  "  Rectors  "  was  a  generic  term,  indi-
cating all  who  governed,  and  there  were  Rectors  of  the  Towers,  of  the  city,
and  of  the  guilds.  Potestas  then  indicated  the  supreme  authority  in
general,  and  was  only  converted  later  on  into  a  special  and  separate  office.

*  There  are  so  many  examples  of  this,  that  quotation  is  unneeded.
It  was  the  usual  formula  in  other  cities  as  well  as  in  Florence.  In  the
treaty  drawn  up  between  Lucca  and  Florence  (July  24,  1184),  from  which
we  have  already  quoted,  there  was  a  proviso  in  case  there  might  be  no
Consuls  at  Lucca,  no  Lucana  Potestas,  and  this  addition  was  accordingly
made  "aut  bonos  viros  lucensis  civitatis,  si  Consules  vel  Rector  aut
Potestas  tunc  ibi  non  fuerit."

Ancients,  and  other  officers  of  later  date;  but  it  is  specially
true  as  applied  to  the  consuls,  under  whom  the  various
civic  societies  were  first  united  in  a  single  government.
Therefore,  to  meet  the  eventuality  of  no  Consuls  being
in  office  at  the  moment,  it  was  provided  that  the  Rectors
of  the  Towers  or  of  the  guilds  should  naturally  assume
the  power  directly  emanating  from  them.  But  as  no
public  acts  performed  in  the  name  of  the  Rectors  are
extant,  we  may  conclude  that  the  contingency  arranged
for  seldom  arose.

Frequent  mention  occurs  of  counsellors  {consilarii).,  and
we  note  that  representatives  of  the  guilds  were  comprised
among  them.  We  know,  in  fact,  that  there  was  a  council
in  Florence,  as  in  other  Italian  communes,  and  Villani
tells  us  (iv.  7,  and  v.  32)  that  this  council  was  called  a
senate  "  according  to  the  custom  given  by  the  Romans  to
the  Florentines,"  and  composed  of  one  hundred  worthies
{Buoni  Uoniini).  In  documents,  however,  they  are  nearly
always  entitled  consiliarii^  the  term  "  senator "  ^  only
occurring  once  ;  but  in  those  days  the  term  senato  or
consiglio^  senator!  or  consiglieri^  were  often  indiscrimi-
nately applied,  particularly  with  regard  to  the  limited  or
Special  Council,  as  it  was  afterwards  called.  No  documents
supply  us  with  the  precise  number  of  the  councillors  ;  but
we  believe  the  one  hundred  recorded  by  Villani  must  be
somewhat  under  the  exact  figure,  since  a  form  of  oath
sworn  by  133  councillors  is  extant.^    Perhaps  each  sestiere

'  "  Forte  Belicocci  Senator  eiusd<fm  [Florentiae]  Civitatis"  (in  a  docu-
ment dated  April  15,  1204,  Santini  pt.  i.  doc.  li ).  Another  document  of
November  13  and  14,  1197,  in  the  Acts  of  the  Tuscan  League,  we  find
the  name  Bilicozus  among  the  consiliarii  present.  In  the  "  Breve
Consulum  Pisane  Civitatis,"  of  1162,  edited  by  Bonaini,  the  councillors
are  styled  senatores.

'  This  document  (Santini,  pt.  i.  doc.  xxii.)  is  that  of  November  13
and  14,  1 197,  and  also  one  of  those  of  the  Tuscan  League.  It  should
be  remarked,  however,  that  even  at  this  grave  juncture  there  were  more
than  twelve  Consuls  ;  so,  too,  for  similar  reasons,  either  the  number  of  the


POPULAR  CHAR  A  CTER  OP  THE  G  0  VERNMENT.      1 2  7

elected  about  twenty  or  twenty-five  members,  without
this  being  the  invariable  rule,  and  thus  the  Council  might
be  approximately  designated  as  that  of  the  "  Hundred."
Then,  too,  there  was  the  parliament,  also  known  as  the
ArengOf  ^  which  was  a  general  assembly  of  the  people,
held  on  great  occasions  for  the  gravest  affairs  of  the  State.


X.

Thus  the  Florentine  Commune  resembled  a  confedera-
tion of  Trade  Guilds  and  Societies  of  the  Towers,  Its
directing  authorities  for  affairs  of  war,  finance,  justice,  and
other  matters  of  the  highest  importance,  were  the  Consuls,
elected  yearly,  with  a  senate  or  council  of  about  a
hundred  worthies,  likewise  elected  yearly,  and  lastly  a
parliament.  The  Consuls  were  almost  invariably  chosen
from  members  of  the  Companies  of  the  Towers,  and  if,
for  any  reason,  no  election  of  Consuls  took  place,  the
rectors  of  the  Towers  or  of  the  guilds  were  provisionally
empowered  to  act  in  their  stead.  But  the  guilds  pre-
dominated in  the  Council,  and  as  a  natural  consequence
the  government  assumed  a  popular  character  from  that
time,  and  the  whole  policy  of  Florence  always  tended  to
promote  the  trade  and  commerce  of  the  city.

Nevertheless,  to  obtain  a  still  clearer  idea  of  a  govern-
ment of  this  kind,  it  would  be  requisite  to  ascertain
exactly  who  and  what  were  the  citizens  entitled  to  a
share  in  it,  and  this  point  is  still  somewhat  doubtful.
The    outlying   territory   {contado)  was    entirely  excluded

councillors  was  augmented,  or  else  (being  towards  the  end  of  the  year)
some  of  the  newly  elected  members  sat  together  with  those  about  to
retire.

'  The  term  arengo,  arrengo,  aringo,  or  arringo,  was  derived  from  the
verb  arringare,  to  harangue,  in  the  same  way  as  parliament  from  the
\txh  Jtarlare,  to  speak.


128     ORIGIN  OF  THE  FLORENTINE  COMMUNE.

from  citizenship,  nor  was  this  privilege  granted  to  all
dwellers  within  the  walls,  the  lower  class  of  artisans  and
the  populace  being  excluded  from  it."^  Hence  the  govern-
ment was  concentrated  in  the  hands  of  a  few  powerful
families,  the  heads  of  the  guilds,  and  their  principal
adherents.  In  fact,  even  down  to  the  last  days  of  the
Republic  real  citizenship — the  possessors  of  which  alone
were  eligible  to  political  posts — was  a  privilege  conceded
to  few,  and  even  in  1494  the  number  of  citizens  scarcely-
exceeded  three  thousand.  For  this  reason,  even  at  the
present  day,  we  may  find  a  few  humble  families  asserting
their  inheritance  of  old  Florentine  civic  rights,  as  a  rare
privilege  and  almost  as  a  title  of  nobility.  At  Venice,
even  in  the  eighteenth  century,  to  the  last  days  of  the
Republic  there  still  existed  different  grades  of  citizenship,
and  the  right  of  government  was  restricted  to  a  small
caste.  This  is  one  of  the  points  in  our  history  demanding
closer  investigation.  It  is  true  that  the  whole  people
met  indistinctly  in  parliament  ;  but  such  assemblies  were
mostly  of  a  purely  formal  kind.  For,  seeing  that  the
parliament  was  convoked  either  in  some  square,  often  of
small  extent,  or  inside  a  church,  we  are  bound  to  infer
that  the  privilege  accorded  to  all  the  inhabitants  of  the
city  was  nominal  rather  than  real.

It  were  likewise  superfluous  to  add  that  the  exact
division  of  power,  as  in  modern  constitutions,  was  entirely
ignored  in  those  days.  Affairs  were  divided  according  to
their  importance  and  the  quality  of  the  individuals  con-
cerned in  them,   rather  than  according  to  their   nature.

'  In  Italian  communes  habitatores^  and  even  assidid  habitafores,  are
clearly  distinguished  both  from  cives  and  foreigners.  Florentine  docu-
ments often  mention  cives  salvatichi,  a  term  that  indicates,  I  believe,  the
quasi  citizenship  of  persons  living  in  the  country,  but  bound  to  dwell
in  the  city  during  part  of  the  year.  These  greatly  increased  in  number
later  on,  and  in  course  of  time  became  real  and  entire  citizens,  in  accor-
dance with  certain  rules  not  yet  fully  known  to  us.


THE  COUNCIL  OF  THE  HUNDRED.  129

The  Council  of  the  Hundred  was  not,  as  might  be  supposed,
at  this  day,  a  legislative  assembly,  nor  was  the  executive
power  vested  in  the  Consuls.  The  latter  gave  judgment,
administered  affairs,  commanded  armies,  executed  the  will
of  the  people,  and  occasionally  completed  legislative  acts
even  without  the  aid  of  the  Council.  This,  however,  was
always  consulted  regarding  very  important  reforms,  but
often  voted  for  or  against  them  without  any  discussion.
On  questions  of  extraordinary  moment  the  parliament
gave  its  placet  without  always  understanding  the  nature
of  the  question.  On  the  other  hand,  not  only  affairs  of
some  gravity,  and  particularly  those  for  which  money  was
needed,  were  referred  to  the  Council  ;  but  this  could  also
be  consulted,  at  the  Consul's  pleasure,  on  any  question
whatever,  from  the  proposed  execution  of  some  political
offender  to  granting  some  citizen  permission  to  transfer
his  abode  from  one  sestiere  to  another,  ^  Although  a
question  of  the  latter  kind  seems  very  insignificant  to  us
nowadays,  it  was  an  important  one  then,  since  it  altered
the  distribution  of  the  inhabitants  in  different  parts  of  the
city,  and  consequently  the  relative  strength  of  these  parts
and  the  proportional  right  of  the  citizens  to  fill  public
offices — a  point  that  was  very  jealously  watched.

Such  was  the  first  form  of  government  adopted  by  the
Florentine  Commune.  But  the  Commune  was  not  yet
consolidated  nor  sufficiently  sure  of  its  strength.  The
territory  beneath  its  sway  was  very  limited  in  extent,  with
ill-defined,  disputable  and  disputed  frontiers.  Even
within  these  borders  the  Commune  had  very  little  power,
inasmuch  as  the  castled  nobility  not  only  vaunted  their
independence  of  the  city,  refusing  to  acknowledge  any
authority  save  that  of  the  Empire,  to  which  they  were
not  always  submissive,  but  waged   constant  war  on  the

'  Many  examples  of  this  have  been  found  by  us  among  provvisioni  (or
decrees)  of  later  date.

Commune,  and  perpetually  incited  neighbouring  lands  to
rebellion.  Accordingly,  the  first  thing  to  be  done  at  this
juncture  was  to  seize  the  contado  by  force  of  arms,
reduce  it  to  subjection  and  govern  it,  the  which,  as  we
shall  see,  led  to  many  new  and  serious  complications,  both
within  and  without  the  walls.  These  vicissitudes  con-
stitute the  real  civil  history  of  Florence,  which  finally
starts  from  this  moment.

envoys  despatched  from  Germany  to
reassume  the  margraviate  of  Tuscany
in  the  name  of  the  Empire  followed
one  another  in  rapid  succession.^  But
almost  all  were  men  of  small  ability,
pursuing  a  vacillating  policy  that  led  to  no  results.
They  tried  to  exercise  the  power  of  margraves,  but
were  merely  temporary  officials  of  the  emperor.
Without  resources,  without  knowledge  of  the  country,
they  relied  now  on  this  party,  now  on  that,  incapable
of  distinguishing  friends  from  foes,  and  never  under-
standing the  causes  of  the  wars  continually  breaking
out  on  every  side.  This  state  of  things,  well  adapted  to
promote   communal  independence,  lasted  to   1162,  when

To  Rabodo  (died  11 19)  succeeded  a  Corrado  (1120-27),  afterwards  a
Rampret  (1131),  then  an  Englebert  (i  134),  then  Errico  of  Bavaria  (1137),
immediately  followed  by  Ulrico  d'Attems,  then  the  Duke  Guelfo  (1160-
62),  uncle  to  the  Emperor  Frederic  I.,  by  whom  he  was  sent.

131


132  FIRST  WARS  AND  FIRST  REFORMS.

Frederic  Barbarossa  began  to  make  the  weight  of  his
hand  felt  by  initiating  a  clearer  and  more  determined
policy,  although  even  his  talent  failed  to  ootam  any
notable  results.

The  Florentines  were  those  best  able  to  profit  by  the
weakness  of  the  Empire.  In  1129  they  took  possession
of  the  Castle  of  Vignalo  in  the  Val  d'Elsa  ;  ^  and  in  1 135
destroyed  the  stronghold  of  Monteboni,  belonging  to  the
Buondelmonti,  whose  name  was  derived  from  it,  and
who  were  now  forced  to  submit  to  the  Commune,  yield
it  military  service,  and  dwell  in  the  city  a  certain  part  of
the  year.2  On  this  head  Villani  remarks  that  the  Com-
mune now  began  to  extend  its  borders  *'  by  violence
rather  than  by  reason,  .  .  .  subjecting  every  noble  of  the
contadoy  and  demolishing  fortresses."  This  was,  in  fact,
the  policy  of  Florence,  and  it  led  to  two  inevitable
results.  An  increase  of  territory  was  the  first  ;  the
second,  that  the  always-increasing  number  of  nobles
brought  into  the  city  paved  the  way  for  the  form.ation
of  an  aristocratic  party  opposed  to  the  people,  and  con-
sequently promoting  civil  strife  and  future  changes  of
government.

In  June,  1135,  the  Imperial  envoy  Engelbert  entered
Florence,  and  seemed  amicable  to  the  Commune. 3  He
speedily  moved  on  to  Lucca,  where  he  met  with  a  serious
defeat.  The  succeeding  envoy,  Errico  of  Bavaria,  came
with  a  considerable  force,  and  appeared  ill-disposed  towards
the  Florentines.  His  stay,  however,  was  short,  and  his
successor,  Ulrico  d'Attems,  showed  friendly  intentions,
and  in  1141  even  aided  the  Florentines  in  a  skirmishing
expedition  against  Sienna.4   But  all  these  envoys  came  and

WAJ?   WITH  COUNT  GUIDO.  133

disappeared  like  meteors.  Florence  was  now  begrinnino
its  great  war  with  Count  Guido,  surnamed  the  Old,  who
had  become  their  foe.  A  contested  inheritance  served  as
a  pretext  for  the  rupture ;  but  the  real  cause  must  have
lain  in  the  increased  power  and  menacing  attitude  of  the
count.  His  possessions  hemmed  in  the  Republic  on
all  sides,  and  Sanzanome  said  of  him,  "  Per  se  quasi
ci vitas  est  et  provincia."  ^  The  citizens  first  seized  a
castle  of  his  near  Ponte  a  Sieve,  and  then  attacked  his
stronghold  of  Monte  di  Croce.  But,  aided  by  neigh-
bouring towns,  the  count  succeeded  in  defeating  the
Florentines  on  June  24,  1 146.  Nevertheless,  they  con-
trived even  then  to  extort  advantageous  terms,  namely  :
that  part  of  the  walls  should  be  dismantled,  and  that
the  castle  should  hoist  the  banner  of  Florence.^  Ail
this  was  done,  and  there  was  truce  for  a  time,  while  the
count  seems  to  have  been  engaged  on  distant  expeditions.
But  later,  the  walls  were  restored,  and  thereupon  the
Florentines,3  declaring  that  the  agreement  had  been  vio-
lated, suddenly  stormed  the  castle  in  1153,  and  rased  it
to  the  ground.  And  thus,  wrote  Sanzanome,  "  Mons
Crucis  est  cruciatus."     Certainly  all  this  could  not  lead  to

'  Sanzanome,  Florentine  ed.,  p.  129.

'  This  is  related  by  an  eye  witness  in  the  Passerini  collection  of  docu-
ments (often  quoted  to  us)  at  p.  389.  The  "  Annales,"  i.,  manifestly  err
in  assigning  precisely  this  date  of  1147  to  the  capture  of  Monte  Orlando,
which  really  happened  in  1107.  The  erasures  in  the  Codex  just  where  the
date  and  places  of  the  event  narrated  are  written — i.e.,  before  the  entry

the  reconstruction  of  the  walls,  both  at  p.  394  and  p.  217.  It  records  at
the  same  point  the  subsequent  destruction  of  Monte  di  Croce  :  "  Et  dixit
quod  sunt  Ix.  annos  quod  fuit  destructus  Mons  Crucis."  Both  Villani
(iv.  37)  and  the  pseudo  Brunetto  Latini  give  the  date  of  11 54;  the
"Annales,"  ii.,  the  Neapolitan  Codex,  and  Paolino  Fieri,  that  of  11 53.
Sanzanome,  according  to  his  frequent  practice,  gives  no  precise  date
even  here  (at  p.  130).  He  merely  says  that  the  first  attack  on  the  castle
took  place  in  1146.

Siennese  on  condition  of  their  fortifying  and  defending  it
against  the  Florentines,  who  were  preparing  to  make  an
assault.  By  accepting  the  gift  Sienna  stood  pledged  to
play  an  active  part  in  the  war,  which  thus  continued  to
spread.  I

II.

Just  at  this  time,  however,  the  state  of  affairs  changed,
for  Tuscany  was  beginning  to  feel  the  influence  of
Frederic  I.  (Barbarossa).  This  emperor,  finding  that
Duke  Guelfo  was  unable  to  make  himself  respected,
despatched  (i  162-3)  the  Archbishop  Reinhold  of
Cologne,  a  man  of  energy  and  brains,  with  the  title
of  *'  Italiae  archicancellarius  et  imperatoriae  maiestatis
legatus,"  and  charged  to  reorganise  the  Imperial  admini-
stration on  a  new  plan.  Frederic  regarded  the  dissolution
of  the  margraviate  as  an  accomplished  fact,  and  wished
to  assume  the  direct  government  of  its  various  component
parts  by  means  of  German  counts  or  Podesta,  in  the
manner  already  adopted  by  him  in  Lombardy.  Reinhold
set  to  the  task  with  zeal,  establishing  German  governors
and  garrisons  in  the  principal  castles  of  the  contado  ;  and
where  no  castles  remained  new  ones  were  erected. 2  San
Miniato,  with  its  tower  on  the  hill,  dominating  the  suburb
of  San  Genesio  below,  was  the  headquarters  of  this  new
administration.     Here  Reinhold  established  Eberhard  von

Amern  with  the  title  of  "  Comes  et  Federici  imperatorL
legaius."  ^  Frederic's  scheme  of  policy  was  clear  and
precise  ;  but  in  order  to  carry  it  into  effect  against  the
will  of  communes  that  were  already  emancipated,  and
against  the  interests  of  many  native  counts,  would  have
required  much  time  and  a  great  army,  both  of  which  were
lacking  at  the  moment.  Reinhold  was  sooa  called  else-
where for  other  undertakings,  and  although  his  successor,
the  Archbishop  Christian  of  Mayence,  was  likewise  a  man
of  ability,  their  efforts  led  to  few  practical  results.  Their
only  success  consisted  in  the  amount  of  money  squeezed
from  the  people ;  for,  as  a  chronicler  puts  it,  "  like  good
fishermen,  they  drew  everything  cleverly  into  their  nets.'*
But  they  established  no  firm  political  basis.

It  is  true  that  the  new  German  Podesta,  or  Teutoniciy  as
they  were  called,  were  seen  springing  up  on  all  sides.  We
now  find,  in  fact,  continual  mention  of  the  Poiestas
Florentiae  and  Florentinorum^  and  of  the  same  digni-
taries in  Sienna,  Arezzo,  and  many  other  towns.  Never-
theless, they  exercised  little  or  no  power  in  great  cities :
these  being  still  governed  by  Consuls,  who  disputed  the
authority  of  the  Teutonici  of  the  contado  outside  the  walls.
This  state  of  things  could  not  be  of  long  continuance.  By
special  permission  from  the  emperor,  the  Consuls  of  certain
well-affected  cities  were  allowed  to  exercise  jurisdiction,
in  his  name,  not  only  within  the  walls,  but  even  some-
times over  part  of  the  contado ;  always,  however,  with  a
reservation  in  favour  of  nobles,  and  often  of  churches  and
convents,  who  were  to  remain  subject  to  the  Imperial
authority  alone. 2  Everywhere  else  in  Central  Italy  the
Imperial  Podesta  were  to  take  the  entire  command,  for  the

emperor  admitted  no  doubt  as  to  the  complete  and  abso-
lute nature  of  his  rights.  But  the  question  now  hinged  on
facts  rather  than  on  rights,  and  was  only  to  be  solved  by
a  greater  force  than  that  possessed  by  the  Empire  in  Tus-
cany. Hence,  an  enormous  confusion  ensued.  All  the
great  cities,  ^nd  more  especially  Florence,  continued  to
rule  themselves  as  before  ;  while  in  the  rural  territories
{contadi)^  Imperial  Podesta,  Tuscan  counts,  feudal  lords.
Consuls  great  and  small,  or  other  officers  of  the  Commune,
daily  contested  one  another's  authority,  and  the  masses  no
longer  knew  whom  to  obey.  Even  the  cities  and  nobles
siding  with  the  Empire  not  only  failed  to  carry  out
Frederic's  designs,  but  actually  opposed  them  ;  for,  in
point  of  fact,  this  Teutonic  over-lordship,  wielded  by
grasping  and  tyrannous  Imperial  officials,  was  equally
odious  to  all.

A  sufficiently  accurate  idea  of  this  state  of  things  may
be  gleaned  from  the  accounts  of  contemporary  witnesses,
who  were  summoned  at  various  times  to  furnish  authentic
details  as  to  the  condition  of  the  country.  Those  sent
to  report  upon  the  monastery  of  Rosano  describe  it  as
being  subject  to  Count  Guido,  who  was  continually  driven
to  defend  it  "  against  the  warden  of  Montegrossoli,  other
Teutons,  and  the  Florentine  Consuls,"  all  of  whom  tried
to  exercise  authority  there.  They  also  describe  how  at
Monte  di  Croce,  the  Consuls  of  that  place  and  the  vice
comites  all  held  command  simultaneously,  and  were  com-
pelled to  defend  themselves  from  the  Teutonici^  and
against  the  encroachments  of  the  Consuls  and  other  officers
of  the  Florentine  Commune.^

On  another  occasion  an  equally  chaotic  state  of  things
is  described  in  the  reports  on  the  castle  and  valley  of
Paterno,  of  which  Florentines  and  Siennese  disputed  the
dominion.     One  witness  tells  us  that  in  his  day  he  saw

*  Vidt:  the  Passerini  Documents,  pp.  208,  394-400,


DISPUTES  WITH  SIENNA.  137

a  certain  Pipino,  Potesias  Florentiae^  holding  sway  there,
and  over  all  the  rest  of  the  Florentine  contado.     Another
records  how  he  visited  the  Paterno  valley  and  the  whole
of  the  contado^  together  with  the  consuls  of  the  Commune
and  a  'Teutonico.     Several  declare  to  have  gone  there  now
with  Pipino,  now  with  other  Teutonici^  and  at  other  times
with  the   Consuls,   and  that  all  received   obedience  and
levied  taxes  in  the  same  way.     Then  we  have  the  curious
deposition  of  one  Giovanni  de  Citinaia,  who  gives  a  long
account  of  recent  events  in  the  district.     He  tells  us  how
a  big  pillar  was  uprooted  by  a  priest,  who,  not  knowing
for  what   purpose  it  had  been   planted,  wanted   to    use
it  for  the  church  he  was  building.     But  it  was  so  heavy
that  even  with  a  cart  and  two  oxen  he  failed  to  remove
it.     And  some  peasants  who  were  looking  on,  cried  out
to  him  :  "  Domini  sacerdos,  male  fecisti,  quia  est  terminus
inter  Florentinos  et  Senenses"  ("  Master  priest,  thou  hast
done  ill,  for  this  is  the  boundary  stone  between  Florence
and  Sienna  ").  After  this,  the  witness  continues,  two  persons
went  to  the   warden  of  Montegrossoli,  and  said  that  if
he  would   help   them  to  rebuild  the  Castle   of  Paterno,
they  would  furnish  him  with  proofs  of  his  right  over  it.
The  warden  cheerfully  hastened  to  Florence   to  get  the
permission   of  the  authorities,  but  quickly  returned,  say-
ing that  the  building  could  not  go  on,  for  the  Florentines
refused    consent,    because    the   Archbishop    Christian    of
Mayence    was    already   in    Lombardy    on    the    way    to
Tuscany.     Thereupon    the    Siennese    made   use    of    the
favourable  opportunity  to  demolish  the  neglected  works,
and    play    the    masters    themselves.     It  is   certainly   im-
possible to  conceive  a  greater  multiplicity  and  confusion
of  contrasting  rights  and  authorities.^

'  Some  of  these  depositions  have  been  printed  before,  but  the  whole
;  collection  is  now  given  in  Santini,  i.  doc.  xlv.      They  are  dated   May,
1203,  but  naturally  refer  to  a  much  earlier  period-     Vide  Santini,  pp.  115,
117-19.


138  FIRST  WARS  AND  FIRST  REFORMS,

Hence  the  only  course  open  to  Florence  and  the
Tuscan  communes  in  general  was  to  seize  every  con-
venient occasion  of  asserting  their  rights  either  by
craft  or  by  violence.  The  war  between  Pisa  and  Lucca
had  already  broken  out,  and  as  Count  Guido,  the  foe  of
the  Florentines,  had  joined  with  Lucca,  they  formed  an
alliance  with  Pisa.  This  treaty  was  very  advantageous
to  their  commerce,  but  it  pledged  them  to  an  active
share  in  the  war.^  They  willingly  undertook  this,  for  it
was  an  opportunity  of  fighting  not  only  the  Lucchese,
but  also  the  latter's  patrons,  Count  Guido  and  Christian
of  Mayence.  At  first  it  seemed  as  though  Pisa  would  be
forced  to  make  peace,  for  on  March  23,  1173,  Christian
declared  that  city  to  be  under  ban  of  the  Empire,  thus
stripping  it  of  all  the  privileges  it  had  previously  enjoyed.
In  fact,  on  the  23rd  of  May  an  agreement  was  concluded
(witnessed  also  by  the  Florentines)  to  the  effect  that
Pisa  and  Lucca  should  proceed  to  an  exchange  of
prisoners.  The  ban  was  raised  on  the  28th  of  the  same
month,  and  peace  was  solemnly  proclaimed  in  Pisa  on
the  1st  of  June.

But  two  months  afterwards  an  unexpected  event
caused  the  war  to  be  speedily  renewed.  The  archbishop
had  invited  the  Consuls  of  Pisa  and  Florence  to  come  to
San  Genesio  on  the  4th  of  August,  and  on  their  arrival
had  them  promptly  seized  and  cast  into  prison.  What
could  have  caused  an  act  rendering  war  unavoidable,  after
such  strenuous  efforts  to  establish  peace  ?  Many  explana-
tions have  been  suggested,  but  one  fact  alone  is  well
ascertained.  Certain  men  of  San  Miniato,  having  been
expelled  as  rebels  to  the  Empire,  had  sought  the  Bishop
of  Florence  2  in  his  palace,  and  sworn  not  only  to  make

ALLIANCE  WITH  PISA.  139

common  cause  with  the  Pisans  and  Florentines,  but  to
cede  them  the  territory  of  San  Miniato,  should  they
succeed  in  retaking  it,  and  even  if  the  fortress  remained
m  the  hands  of  the  Germans. ^  This  is  certainly  true,
for  the  document  containing  the  agreement  is  still  extant.
It  is  no  regular  treaty,  being  unwitnessed  by  Consuls,
and  lacking  the  proper  legal  formulas.  But  the  fact  of
its  having  been  sworn  to  and  signed  in  the  bishop's  palace  ;
of  some  leading  citizens,  including  one  of  the  Uberti,^
having  been  parties  to  it  ;  and  of  the  document  being
preserved  in  the  Archives,3  proves  that  the  rulers  of  the
two  cities  were  not  unaware  of  the  agreement,  but  merely
preferred  to  hide,  or  rather  disguise  the  real  importance
of  it.  All  this,  joined  to  their  reluctance  and  delay  as  to
the  exchange  of  prisoners,  persuaded  Christian  that  they
were  trying  to  trick  and  betray  him  by  a  fictitious  peace.
Accordingly,  his  patience  being  exhausted,  he  was  led  to
commit  an  imprudent  and  ill-considered  action,  that
destroyed  all  hope  of  the  peace  he  was  so  anxious  to
conclude.

In  fact,  by  August  the  Florentines  were  already  at
Castel  Fiorentino,  and,  reinforced  by  a  contingent  of  225
horse,  accompanied  by  two  Consuls  from  Pisa,  encamped
at  Pontedera.  Christian  quickly  marched  against  them,
together  with  Guido  and  the  Lucchese,  but  the  latter
were  obliged  to  forsake  him,  for  the  Pisans,  by  advice
of  the  Florentines,  had  entered  the  Lucca  territory  and
were  laying  it  waste.  Notwithstanding  his  diminished
force  he   attacked  the  enemy,  and  vaUantly  defended  his

'  "  Castrum  autem  intelligimus  recuperatum  etiam  sine  superiori
incastellatura."

'  At  this  moment  many  former  partisans  of  the  Empire  were  fighting
against  it.     Pisa  is  one  example.

^  Nevertheless  it  was  not  kept  among  the  Capitoli  comprising  real
official  documents,  but  among  papers  of  an  almost  private  nature.
Hartwig  was  the  first  to  bring  it  to  light  (ii.  61)  ;  and  it  was  afterwards
reprinted  verbatim  in  Santini,  pt.  iii.  doc.  i.

banner,  but  was  worsted  in  the  fight.  How  the  war  went
on  is  unknown  to  us  ;  but  it  is  certain  that  Christian  soon
took  his  departure,  that  in  1174  the  rebels  of  San  Miniato
returned  with  honour  to  their  native  town,  and  that  finally
in  the  following  year  peace  was  concluded  between  the
three  hostile  cities. '

Meanwhile  the  Florentines  continued  to  subject  the
towns  and  castles  of  the  territory  to  their  rule.2  Before
this,  in  1 1 70,  they  had  wrung  hard  conditions  from  the
Aretines,3  who  were  friendly  to  Count  Guido,  and  they
now  marched  against  Asciano,  a  walled  town  near  Arezzo,
partly  under  their  rule  and  partly  under  that  of  the
Siennese,  who  were  now  trying  to  get  full  possession  of  it.
The  latter  were  routed  on  July  7,  11 74,  and  leaving  a
thousand  prisoners  in  the  enemy's  hands  were  accordingly
obliged  to  submit  to  very,  disadvantageous  terms.4  The
negotiations  were  carried  on  slowly,  but  peace  was
concluded  at  last  in   11 76.

The  Florentines  were  acknowledged  as  the  legitimate
masters  of  the  whole  contado  of  Fiesole  and  Florence,  and
obtained  part  of  the  Siennese  possessions  at  Poggibonsi,  the
said  Siennese  being  bound  to  help  them  in  all  wars,5  save

against  the  emperor  or  his  envoys,  and  likewise  pledged
to  use  every  endeavour  to  conciliate  the  latter  in  favour
of  Florence.  Several  more  of  the  conditions  were  particu-
larly harsh. I  That  the  Florentines  could  extort  such
terms  as  these  after  the  petty  war  of  Asciano  is  an
undeniable  proof  of  their  increased  power ;  but  it  is
equally  certain  that  unless  the  Siennese  were  hopelessly
ruined,  this  was  only  a  fictitious  peace,  concluded  after
great  hesitation,  and  for  the  sole  purpose  of  securing  the
release  of  the  prisoners.


Ill,


Nevertheless,  these  triumphs  abroad  were  counteracted
by  unforeseen  events  in  Florence  itself.  Owing  to  the
prevalence  of  the  popular  party  in  the  consular  govern-
ment, powerful  houses  in  general,  and  the  Uberti  faction  in
particular,  were  increasingly  excluded  from  public  affairs,
and  naturally  showed  signs  of  discontent.  At  this  moment
we  seldom  find  any  of  their  names  at  the  head  of  the
Commune. 2  Meanwhile,  however,  many  neighbouring
castles  and  lands  having  been  reduced  to  submission,  the
number  of  nobles  of  the  contado  dwelling  in  the  city  had
been  greatly  augmented.  These,  being  merely  counted  as
assidui  habit  at  ores  or  cives  salvatichi^  could  have  no  share
in  the  government,  but  there  was  nothing  to  prevent  them
from  joining  the  disaffected  party  and  swelling  its  num-
bers and  strength.  And  when,  in  course  of  time,  they
became  full  citizens,  their  power  of  action  was  enlarged.

of  Consuls.     Santini,  i.  doc.  vi.


142  FIRST  WARS  AND  FIRST  REFORMS.

Accordingly,  at  last,  in  1177,  the  Uberti  were  encouraged
to  hazard  the  revolution  that  first  initiated  civil  war  in
Florence.

All  the  chroniclers  speak  of  this  war,  and  it  must
have  been  of  considerable  importance,  seeing  that  it  was
pursued  for  nearly  two  years  with  much  bloodshed  and
the  destruction  by  fire  of  the  greater  part  of  the  city.
Likewise,  the  river  Arno  overflowed  and  broke  down  the
Ponte  Vecchio.  Villani  describes  the  two  fires  of  1177,
saying  that  the  first  extended  from  the  bridge  to  the  Old
Market ;  the  second,  from  San  Martino  del  Vescovo  to
Santa  Maria  Ughi  and  the  Cathedral.  He  also  relates  the
fall  of  the  bridge,  adding,  as  usual,  that  all  this  was  a
righteous  chastisement  from  Heaven  on  the  proud,  un-
grateful, sinful  city.  He  speaks  of  the  revolution  that
occurred  at  the  same  time  as  though  it  had  nothing  to  do
with  the  burning  of  the  town.  He  goes  on  to  say  that
the  Uberti,  who  were  the  "  principal  and  most  powerful
citizens  of  Florence,  with  their  followers,  both  noble  and
plebeian,  began  to  make  war  against  the  Consuls,  lords
and  rulers  of  the  Commune,  at  a  fixed  moment  and  on
a  fixed  plan,  from  hatred  of  the  Signory,  which  was
not  to  their  liking.  And  the  war  was  so  fierce,  that  in
many  parts  neighbours  fought  against  neighbours  from
fortified  towers,  the  which  were  100  to  120  braccia  in
height  (150  to  180  feet).  Likewise  certain  new  towers
were  erected  by  the  street  companies  with  monies  obtained
from  neighbours,  and  these  were  called  the  Towers  of  the
Companies.

For  two  years  the  fighting  went  on  in  this  fashion,  and
with  much  slaughter  ;  and  the  citizens  became  so  inured
to  perpetual  strife,  that  they  would  fight  one  day  and  eat
and  drink  together  the  next,  recounting  one  to  another
their  various  deeds  and  prowess.  At  last,  tired  out,  they
made    peace,  and  the   Consuls  remained  in  power  ;    but


CIVIL  WAR.  143

these  things  created  and  gave  birth  to  the  accursed  factions
which  soon  broke  out  in  Florence."  ^

On  the  other  hand,  the  pseudo  Brunetto  Latini  dates  the
first  fire  extending  from  the  bridge  to  the  Old  Market,
on  August  4,  1 177.  But  he  quickly  adds  that  in  the
same  year  began  the  "  discord  and  war,  for  the  space  of
twenty-seven  months,  between  the  Consuls  and  the  Uberti,
who  refused  to  obey  either  the  Consuls  or  the  Signory,
yet  nevertheless  formed  no  government  of  their  own.  This
strife  among  the  citizens  caused  great  mortality,  robbery,
and  arson.  The  city  was  set  on  fire  at  five  different
points  ;  the  Sesto  d'Oltrarno,  and  the  part  between  the
Churches  of  San  Martino,  del  Vescovo,  and  Sta.  Maria,
were  burnt  down."  ^  According  to  the  same  chronicler,
the  fall  of  the  bridge  took  place  on  November  4,  1178,
and  the  civil  war  only  came  to  an  end  in  1 1 80,  with
the  triumph  of  the  Uberti,  one  of  whom,  Uberto  degli
Uberti,  actually  became  Consul.  "  The  which  afterwards
led  to  the  creation  of  Podesta,  who  were  nobles,  powerful,
and  of  foreign  birth."  3

»  Villani,  v.  8.  The  "  Annales,"  ii.,  of  1177,  say  that  "  Orta  est  guerra
inter  Consules  et  filios  Uberti ;  eodem  anno  combustu  est  civitas
florentina."  The  Neapolitan  Codex  dates  the  first  fire  the  4th  of  August,
as  Villani  also  does,  and  gives  the  commencement  of  the  civil  war
immediately  afterwards,  the  which  "  filled  two  years."  Paolino  Fieri
dates  the  first  fire  August  4,  1174,  and  the  fall  of  the  bridge  and  the
second  fire  in  11 78.  Tolomeo  da  Lucca  merely  states  that  a  revolution
broke  out  in  1177  and  lasted  for  two  years.

'  Chronicle  of  the  pseudo  Brunetto  Latini,  ad  annum.

3  We  subjoin  an  extract  from  the  pseudo  Brunetto  Latini,  as  it  stands
in  the  Gaddi  Codex,  with  all  its  blunders.  After  giving  an  account  of  the
revolution,  the  chronicler  goes  on  to  say  :  "Then  in  the  year  11 80  the
Uberti  gained  the  victory,  and  Messer  Uberto  degli  Uberti  and  Messer
Lamberto  Lamberti  were  consul  and  rector  of  the  city  of  Florence,
together  with  their  companions,  and  these  formed  the  first  consulate  of
the  city,  the  which  was  brought  about  by  violence,  only  afterwards  they
began  to  rule  the  city  according  to  reason  and  justice,  every  one  pre-
serving his  own  position,  so  that  it  was  decided  by  the  citizen  Consuls  to
summon  powerful  nobles  of  foreign  birth  to  fill  the  post  of  Podest^,  as
will  be   shown  to  you  in  writing  farther  on."     It  is  strange  that  the


144  FIRST  WARS  AND  FIRST  REFORMS.

In  spite  of  a  few  seeming  contradictions  on  the  part  of
both  chroniclers,  their  evidence,  joined  to  that  of  others,
clearly  proves  that  in  1177  a  revolution  led  by  the
Uberti  took  place  and  lasted  about  two  years,  accompanied
by  rapine,  murder,  and  arson.  The  Uberti  did  not  gain
a  complete  victory,  since  the  consular  government  sur-
vived ;  but  they  and  their  friends  were  in  power  more
frequently  than  before,  and  for  this  reason  the  pseudo
Brunetto  Latini  considers  them  to  have  conquered.  All
this  gave  the  government  a  more  patrician  tendency.  It
heralded  the  change  that  replaced  the  Consuls  by  a
Podesta,  and  cast  the  first  seed  of  the  factions  and  civil
wars  destined  to  involve  the  city  in  long-continued  strife
and  bloodshed.  Such,  in  fact,  is  the  gist  of  the  chronicles,
and  all  later  documents  and  events  serve  to  confirm  it.
Nevertheless,  peace  was  re-established  within  the  walls  for
the  nonce,  and  the  policy  of  Florence  remained  unaltered.
The  partial  triumph  of  the  aristocracy  had  at  least  one
good  effect  ;  inasmuch  as  the  nobles,  being  satisfied  for  the
moment,  lent  efficacious  assistance  to  the  Commune,  and
enabled  all  its  affairs  to  be  pushed  forward  more  briskly.

In  fact,  on  February  3,  11 82,  the  people  of  Empoli
were  reduced  to  submission,  bound  over  to  pay  annual
tribute  and  to  yield  military  service  at  the  request  of  the
Florentine  Consuls,  whether  of  the  Commune  or  the
Guilds,  save  in  the  event  of  a  war  against  the  Counts
Guidi.i     The  people  of  Pogna,  which  was  a  fief  of  the

chronicler  should  ascribe  the  origin  of  the  Consuls  to  so  late  a  date.
But,  seeing  that  his  list  of  these  magistrates  only  begins  at  this  point,  it
would  seem  that  he  really  believed  them  to  have  no  earlier  origin.  Never*
theless,  shortly  before,  in  writing  of  1177,  he  had  stated  that  the  Uberti
began  to  make  war  on  the  Consuls ;  hence  it  is  clear  that  even  in  his
opinion  they  had  existed  before  the  year  1180.  Still,  blunders  and
incongruities  of  this  sort  are  frequently  found  even  in  Villani  and  other
chroniclers  of  the  same  period.

'  Santini,  i.  doc.  xii.  This  is  the  document  stating  that  the  tribute  of
fifty  pounds  of  "  good  money"  was  to  be  paid  to  the  Consuls  of  the  city,
or,  failing  these,  to  the  Consuls  of  the  merchants,  authorised  to  receive  it
for  the  Commune.


FRESH  WARFARE.  145

A.lberti,i  were  the  next  to  make  surrender  on  the
4.th  of  March.  And  these  Pognesi  not  only  pledged
themselves  to  take  the  field  at  the  command  of  the
Florentine  Consuls,  but  to  abstain  from  constructing  new
walls  or  fortresses,  either  on  their  own  territory  or  the
neighbouring  lands  of  Semifonte.  Also,  should  others
ittempt  to  fortify  those  places,  they  (the  Pognesi)  were
bound  to  oppose  it  and  give  notice  of  the  fact  to  the
Florentines,  who,  on  their  side,  promised  friendship  and
protection. 2  In  the  same  year  the  Castle  of  Monte-
Trossoli  was  captured  by  the  Florentines. 3  On  July  21,
1 1 84,  they  made  an  alliance  with  the  people  of  Lucca,
who  promised  to  send  them  yearly  a  contingent  of  one
hundred  and  fifty  horse  and  five  hundred  foot,  for  at
least  twenty  days'  service,  in  all  wars  waged  within
Florentine  territory.4  In  October  the  Florentines  attacked
the  Castle  of  Mangona  in  the  Mugello,  but  as  this  fortress
belonged  to  the  Alberti,  the  latter  stirred  Pogna  to
rebellion,  and  the  Florentines   quickly  marched   against

and  of  the  merchants  were  to  be  included  in  the  number.  We  note  that
in  naming  the  Consuls  a  hint  is  already  given  of  the  possible  election  of

that  town.'  Count  Albert!  seems  to  have  taken  part  in
the  fight  that  ensued  at  Pogna,  for  it  is  known  that  by
November  he  was  in  captivity  and  forced  to  accept  very
hard  terms  for  himself,  his  wife  and  his  children.  He  had
to  promise  to  dismantle  his  fortress  of  Pogna  the  following
April,  only  retaining  his  own  palace  and  tower  ;  to
demolish  the  tower  of  Certaldo,  and  never  rebuild  that  of
Semifonte.  He  was  to  cede  to  the  Florentines  whichever
one  of  the  Capraia  towers  they  chose  to  take  ;  he  was  to
give  them  one-half  of  the  ransom  or  tax  to  be  levied  on
all  his  possessions  in  general  between  the  Arno  and  the
Elsa.  Finally,  as  soon  as  he  should  be  released  from
prison  {^'■postquam  exiero  de  prescione  "),  he  was  pledged  to
compel  all  his  men  to  swear  fealty,  and  to  the  payment  of
four  hundred  pounds  of  good  Pisan  money.  His  sons
were  to  reside  in  Florence  two  months  of  the  year  in  time
of  war,  one  month  in  time  of  peace.2  The  subjection  and
humiliation  of  this  Count  Alberto  was  a  very  significant
fact  in  itself.  And  when  we  reflect  that  it  occurred  after
Florence  had  already  overthrown  the  Cadolingi,  lowered
the  power  of  the  Guidi  house,  and  concluded  most  favour-
able alliances  with  Pisa,  Sienna,  and  Lucca,  it  will  be  easily
seen  how  quickly  the  Commune  had  been  able  to  soar  to
a  position  of  very  great  and  almost  menacing  strength.

All  this  certainly  contributed  no  little  to  hasten  the
coming  of  the  Emperor  Frederic  I.,  and,  in  fact,  we  find

'  The  "  Annales,"  ii.,  the  pseudo  Brunette  Latini,  and  the  Neap.  Cod.
date  the  event  in  1185  ;  Villani  (v.  ii.)  dates  it  instead  1184,  and  says  that
Pogna  was  occupied  by  nobles,  who  were  cattani  and  hostile  to  Florence.
We  follow  Villani,  for  otherwise  it  would  be  impossible  to  explain  the
captivity  of  Count  Alberto  in  11 84,  an  event  confirmea  by  documeniary
evidence.

him  in  Tuscany  for  the  deliberate  purpose  of  reducing  the
country  to  subjection  in  the  year  11 85.  But  he  came
without  an  army,  rehant  on  the  might  of  the  Empire,  on
his  own  shrewdness,  and  his  own  reputation.  He  believed
in  the  possibility  of  achieving  his  plans  by  alienating
some  of  the  Tuscan  cities  from  Florence,  and  compelling
them  to  side  with  the  Empire  against  her.  Above  all,
he  counted  upon  Pistoia,  situated  between  Lucca  and
Florence,  and  hostile  to  both  ;  upon  Pisa,  whom  he  hoped,
by  means  of  large  concessions,  to  win  back  to  the  Imperial
cause,  to  which  she  had  so  often  adhered  before.  He
became  still  more  hopeful  of  success  when,  on  reaching
San  Miniato,  in  the  summer  of  11 85,  many  nobles  of  the
contado  came  to  do  him  homage,  with  loud  complaints  ot
the  oppressive  rule  of  the  free  cities.  On  the  25th  of
July  he  emancipated  many  of  these  nobles,  and  some  of
their  fiefs,  from  the  jurisdiction  of  Lucca. ^  On  the  31st
of  the  same  month  he  entered  Florence,  still  surrounded
by  nobles  of  the  contado^  who,  as  Villani  says,  complained
bitterly  of  the  city,  "  which  had  seized  their  castles,  and
thus  grossly  insulted  the  Empire."  2  Hereupon,  the
chroniclers  affirm  that  Frederic  deprived  Florence  of  the
right  of  jurisdiction  over  her  own  territory,  even  just
outside  the  city  walls  ;  and  even  assert  that  he  adopted
the  same  measure  with  regard  to  all  the  Tuscan  towns,
excepting  Pisa  and  Pistoia. 3  But  this  point  has  been
seriously  disputed,  many  refusing  to  admit  the  possibility
of  a  fact  unsupported  by  any  documentary  proof.  On
the  other  hand,  some  writers  consider  it  to  be  proved  by
a  later  event,  the  which  is  not  only  related  by  several
chroniclers,  but  also  confirmed  by  existing  documents.

148  FIRST  WARS  AND  FIRST  REFORMS.

In  fact,  by  a  patent  dated  June  24,  1187,  Henry  VI,,
in  reward,  as  he  expressed  it,  for  services  rendered  by  the
Florentines  to  his  father  and  himself,  granted  them  judicial
rights  over  the  city  and  the  contado  beyond,  to  the  distance
of  one  mile  in  the  direction  of  Fiesole,  of  three  tov^ards
Settimo  and  Campi,  and  of  ten  in  all  other  directions. ^
Even  w^ithin  these  narrow  limits,  however,  the  nobles  and
soldiery  were  to  be  independent  of  the  city.  In  token  of
gratitude  for  this  liberality  on  the  part  of  the  emperor,
the  Florentines  were  bound  to  present  him  every  year
with  a  piece  of  good  samite,  bonum  examitum?-  Similar
and  equally  limited  concessions  were  granted  to  other
cities  also. 3  Accordingly,  some  have  said,  since  Henry
restored  right  of  jurisdiction  to  the  Florentines,  it  is  clear
that  his  father  had  deprived  them  of  it  In  fact,  we  know
that  throughout  Tuscany  Frederic  established  Imperial
Podesta,  who  bore  the  names  of  their  respective  cities.4

'  The  chroniclers  only  say,  with  obvious  inexactitude,  for  ten  miles
round.

"  This  diploma  is  given  in  Ficker,  iv.  doc.  170,  p.  213.  Henry  (then
Henry  VI.,  King  of  the  Romans,  afterwards,  as  emperor,  also  called
Henry  V.),  after  granting  the  concession,  adds  :  "Excepto  ac  salvo  iure
nobilium  et  militum,  a  quibus  etiam  volumus  ut  Florentini  nihil  exigant."
The  diploma  only  refers  in  general  terms  to  the  services  rendered  by  the
Florentines  to  Henry  and  to  his  father,  Frederic  I.  Villani  considers
the  grant  a  reward  for  their  prowess  in  the  Crusade ;  but  the  Crusade  took
place  in  11 89,  and  the  grant  was  made  in  1187  ;  for  although  he  wrongly
dates  the  latter  in  1188,  this  blunder  does  not  suffice  to  remove  the
anachronism.  Besides,  he  also  states  that  the  concession  was  granted
through  the  intervention  of  Pope  Gregory  VIII.,  who  was  elected  in
1 1 87,  and  died  the  same  year.

3  In  1 186  Perugia  was  granted  judicial  rights  over  the  contado  beyond
the  walls:  "Exceptis  domibus  et  possessionibus, quas  habent  marchiones
et  monasterium  S.  Salvatoris,"  and,  excepting  several  nobles,  specified
by  name,  "  in  quibus  nihil  iuris  Perusinis  relinquitur."  Ficker,  i.  par.
128,  p.  242.  Sienna,  alter  being  deprived  of  the  contado  in  June,  1186,
received  it  back  in  October,  under  the  same  conditions,  and  so,  too,
Lucca  in  the  same  year.  Ficker,  i.  par.  125.  p.  239,  and  par.  128,

from  the  depositions  of  witnesses.  Vide  Ficker,  vol.  iii.  p.  440.  Hartwig
(ii.  192)  cites  one  Henricus  comes Jlorentinus^  also  mentioned  by  Stumpf


FREDERIC  BARBAROSSA.  149

Also,  reasoning  in  this  style,  those  writers  went  so  far  as
to  suppose  Florence  to  have  been  deprived  of  judicial
powers  even  within  the  city  walls.  But,  as  we  have  seen,
Henry's  patent  does  not  speak  of  restitution — only  of  the
liberality  shown  in  rewarding  the  services  of  the  Floren-
tines, although  it  is  impossible  to  understand  what  those
services  could  have  been.^  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  hard
to  believe  that  Florence,  who  had  dared,  in  weaker  times,
to  use  violent  measures  against  the  Imperial  envoys,  mur-
dering Rabodo  and  putting  Christian  of  Mayence  to  flight,
should  now,  when  so  much  stronger,  and  the  chief  power
in  Tuscany,  unresistingly  submit  to  deprivation  of  judicial
rights  throughout  her  own  territory,  and  even  within  the
city  walls.  In  addition  to  all  this,  there  seems  no  doubt
that  there  were  Consuls  of  Florence  during  the  same
period,  and  therefore  the  theory  of  there  being  Imperial
Podesta  in  the  city  itself  naturally  falls  to  the  ground.
In  feet,  the  Consuls'  names  are  recorded  in  documents  of
1 1 84.  It  is  true  that,  for  the  three  following  years,  the
pseudo  Brunetto  Latini  is  the  only  authority  by  whom
they  are  mentioned  ;  but  it  is  difficult  to  suppose  that  he
invented  them  all,  or  that  he  could  have  been  mistaken
three  consecutive  times.  Although  during  these  three
years  no  documents  give  the  names  of  the  Consuls,  they
afford,  indirectly,  continual  hints  of  their  existence. 2

and  who  seems  to  have  been  a  Podestk  of  the  <r£»«/<3^(9  in  September,  11 86.
After  all  this,  it  is  not  surprising  that  the  Imperial  authority  should  be
often  referred  to  in  documents  of  the  latter  half  of  the  twelfth  century.
We  may  cite  some  instances  from  the  rolls  of  the  Florence  Archives  :
October  14,  1175  (Passignano),  "  Sub  obligo  Consulum  Florentinorum  vel
Nuntio  Regis";  October  g,  1185  (Passignano),  "Sub  duplice  pena  Impera-
toris  et  eius  Missi  aut  quicumque  habuerint  dominium  pro  tempore."

150  FIRST  WAJRS  AND  FIRST  REFORMS.

Hence  It  is  necessary,  in  my  opinion,  to  begin  by
recognising  that,  according  to  the  ideas  and  the  policy  of
Frederic  I.,  there  was  no  question  as  to  his  right  of
exercising  jurisdiction  over  Tuscany;  and  that  if  the  cities
had  virtually  exercised  this  right  without  a  special  grant
to  that  effect,  they  had  violated  thereby  the  rights  of  the
emperor,  who  was  accordingly  justified  in  resuming  them.
For  this  end,  he  had  commissioned  Reinhold  and  Christian
to  establish  Podesta  everywhere,^  and  to  restore  affairs  to
what  he  deemed  their  sole  legal  and  normal  condition.
Only  the  difficulty  here  was  not  in  proving  his  right,
according  to  the  Imperial  theory,  but  in  being  able  to
enforce  it.  It  was  a  question  of  fact,  only  to  be  resolved
by  force.  As  we  have  seen,  Imperial  Podesta  were  estab-
lished on  all  sides  ;  and  while  even  in  the  contado  they
could  only  obtain  partial  and  somewhat  contested  obedi-
ence, in  the  greater  cities,  and  particularly  in  Florence,
they  obtained  none  at  all.  The  Pot  estates  Florentiae,  or
Florentinorum,  as  of  Sienna  or  the  Siennese,  whose  names  so
often  occur,  are  almost  invariably — and  in  the  case  of
Florence,  one  may  say  quite  invariably — Imperial  Podesta,
established  in  the   contado y  and  disputing  its  jurisdiction

frequent  allusions  of  the  following  kind:  April  30,  1185  (Passignano),
"Sub  obligo  Consulum  Florentie  resarcire  promitto";  December  13,
1185  (Santa  Felicitk),  "  Sub  obligo  Consulum  Florentie"  ;  April  26,  1186
(Passignano),  "Penam  ad  Consules  Florentie";  September  21,  1187
(Arch.  Capitolare,  629),  "  Consulum  vel  Rectorum  pro  tempore  Florentie
existentium  (Actum  Florentie)."  The  rolls  of  the  Arch.  Capitolare  were
examined  by  Santini,  to  whom  we  are  indebted  for  the  information  ;
those  of  the  Florence  Archives  we  have  personally  examined,  but  some
of  these  were  first  brought  under  our  notice  by  Santini.

In  1 189  there  were  undoubtedly  Consuls.  Not  only  are  the  names
of  three  of  them  recorded  by  the  pseudo  Brunetto  Latini,  but  documents
give  the  names  of  the  Consuls  of  justice.     Santini,  ii.  docs.  v.  and  vi.

'  Ficker  (ii.  par.  313,  p.  234)  cites  the  words  of  Pillius,  a  jurist  of  the
period :  "  Ut  quando  faciunt  castellanos  vel  comites  in  Tuscia  "  ;  and,
further  on  :  "  Sicut  fit  hodie  illis,  qui  pracficiuntur  in  singulis  provinciis,
vel  in  parte  alicuius  provinciae,  ut  in  comitatu  senensi,  florentjno  vel
aretino."


ESTABLISHMENT  OF  IMPERIAL  PODESTA.     151

with  the  Consuls.  Now,  seeing  that  the  commune  con-
sidered the  contado  to  be  its  own  territory,  and  therefore
craved  the  sole  command  of  it,  while  from  the  Imperial
point  of  view  city  and  contado  were  equally  subject  to  the
Podesta  of  the  Empire,  it  naturally  followed  that  these
dignitaries  were  commonly  styled  Podesta  of  Florence  or
of  the  Florentines  ;  and  in  the  same  way,  Podesta  of
Sienna  or  of  the  Siennese,  of  Arezzo  or  the  Aretini,  &c.
But,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  they  not  only  failed  to  command
obedience  within  the  gates  of  great  cities,  but  even  in  the
contado  outside  were  continually  in  conflict  with  the  con-
sular authority.  We  have  already  seen  what  a  chaos  was
the  result.  Nevertheless,  it  seems  natural  to  believe
that  the  arrival  of  Frederic  I.  in  Tuscany  must  have
strengthened  immensely  the  power  of  these  Podesta,  and
that,  at  least  for  a  time,  they  must  have  been  enabled  to
enforce  their  judicial  rights  throughout  the  country,  and
to  the  very  gates  of  the  town.  This  made  the  chroniclers
assert  that  the  emperor  had  stripped  Florence  of  its  con-
tado. It  is  certain,  however,  that  on  his  departure  things
rapidly  lapsed  into  their  previous  condition.  That  is  to
say,  the  consuls  did  their  utmost  to  neutralise  the  action
and  authority  of  the  Imperial  officials.  The  rise  of  the
communes  had  created  a  new  state  of  things  which  the
Empire  was  powerless  to  destroy,  even  while  refusing  to
acknowledge  its  legal  value.  Therefore  Henry  was  finally
driven  to  accord  a  partial  valuation,  in  the  guise  of  a
generous  concession,  to  an  actuality  that  by  this  means
he  might  at  least  hope  to  keep  within  definite  limits.

And  in  reality  his  patent  of  11 87  granted  Florence
much  less  than  she  had  possessed  for  some  time  before.
If,  in  fact,  the  territory  of  the  Commune  was  not  to
extend  more  than  one  mile  in  the  direction  of  Fiesole,
this  latter  city  remained  outside  the  border,  althoucrh
already  subjected  to  Florence  by  force  of  arms,  together

with  the  whole  of  its  contado^  which,  indeed,  as  proved  by
every  treaty,  had  been  incorporated  in  the  Florentine
territory  since  1125.  Also,  as  though  this  were  not
enough,  Henry  declared  all  nobles  within  the  circum-
scribed area  left  to  the  city,  to  be  exempted  from  its
jurisdiction,  even  including  those  who  had  legally  and
officially  made  submission  to  it.  Notwithstanding  all
this,  Florence  found  it  best  to  accept  the  Imperial  grant.
Thus  things  remained  practically  as  before — that  is  to  say,
the  Commune  could  continue  to  hold  the  virtual  com-
mand, and  snatch  as  much  more  as  should  be  possible.
The  chronicler  Paolino  Fieri,  in  recording  this  concession,
states  that  the  Florentines  regained  the  contado — "  that  is,
they  took  it  back,"  and  by  this  phrase  he  unconsciously
defines  the  real  condition  of  things.  Meanwhile,  the
Empire  yielded  the  point  legally  by  recognising  the
judicial  rights  of  the  Consuls  within  the  city  and  over
part  of  the  contado  outside.  As  to  the  rest,  it  was
left  to  be  decided,  as  in  the  past,  by  force  of  arms.
All  this  serves,  in  our  opinion,  to  make  things  clear,  and
likewise  to  explain  the  inexactitude  and  confusion  of  the
chroniclers,  who,  unable  to  distinguish  between  the  practical
and  legal  side  of  the  question,  continually  jumbled  both
together.  Undoubtedly  it  was  hard  to  disentangle  them,
seeing  that  the  fact  was  confronted  by  two,  or  rather
three,  separate  rights,  each  refusing  to  acknowledge  the
others — namely,  the  right  of  the  Empire,  that  of  the
Commune,  and,  lastly,  that  of  the  Pope,  whose  voice
was  always  heard  repeating — although  always  in  vain —
that  the  Church  was  Matilda's  sole  heir.

V.

Nevertheless,  the  presence  in  the    contado  of  German
Podesta    or    counts   exercised    some  influence,   even   if


EFFECT  PRODUCED  BY  THE  PODESTA.        153

indirectly,  on  the  city  itself.  Or  rather,  their  presence
contributed  to  modify  its  constitution  by  promoting  in  a
certain  way  the  creation  of  a  new  civic  magistracy,  bearing
their  own  title.  In  fact,  the  Latin  term  of  ■potestas^
poiestd^  or  podesta  was  given  to  every  chief  authority
during  the  Middle  Ages  ;  even  in  1068  it  was  the  title
attributed  to  Duke  Goffredo  of  Tuscany.  Later,  it  was
bestowed  on  the  German  counts  governing  the  contado  in
the  name  of  Frederic  I.  From  them  it  was  afterwards
transferred  to  municipal  magistrates.  It  seems  to  have
been  given  first  to  officials  despatched  by  the  Commune
to  the  contado^  when  this  was  already  occupied  by  German
counts,  in  order  to  imitate  and  oppose  them.  At  least,
there  is  reason  to  believe  that  certain  officials  with  Italian
names,  and  bearing  the  title  of  Podesta  of  Florence — or
of  Florentine  Podesta — before  any  such  post  had  been
created  in  the  city,  must  have  been  of  this  class.  Two  of
these  officials,  Renuccio  da  Stagia  and  Guerrierl,  are  known
to  us  and  mentioned  more  than  once  in  the  Rosano
reports.!  J^  seems  probable  enough  that  Renuccio  may
have  been  appointed  before  the  year  1 180  ^ — that  is,  when
there  were  assuredly  Consuls  in  Florence. 3  Hence  it  is
to  be  concluded  that  he  held  office  in  the  contado.  But
whether  or  no  this  theory  be  admissible,  it  should  be
noted  that  all  Florentine  documents  of  the  time,  when
mentioning  the  Consuls,  always  add  the  words  :  "  sive
Rector  vel  Potestas,  vel  Dominator."  At  first  it  is  merely
a  generic  formula,  vaguely  suggesting  the  possibility  of
another  magistrature.      But  little  by  little   the  formula

'  They  are  both  named  in  the  Passerini  documents,  from  which  we
have  frequently  quoted.

3  We  find  in  the  Passerini  documents  (p.  206)  that  one  of  the  witnesses
states  that  Count  Guidi  "  defendit  ipsum  monasterium  [of  Rosano]  a
Teutonicis  et  a  Renuccio  de  Stagia,  quando  erat  Potestas  Florentinorum,
et  a  Consulibus  Florentinis,"

assumes  a  more  concrete  character ;  the  term  Potestas
becoming  of  so  much  more  importance,  as  to  often  pre-
cede that  of  Consules.^  Then,  the  new  office  is  on  the
point  of  birth  ;  and  finally,  in  1193,  makes  its  appearance
in  the  person  of  Gherardo  Caponsacchi,  a  Florentine
belonging  to  a  consular  family.

Ammirato  was  mistaken  in  thinking  that  there  had  been
a  magistrate  of  this  kind  in  the  year  1 1 84,  because  he  found
that  the  treaty  of  alliance  between  Florence  and  Lucca
mentioned  no  individual  in  particular,  but  made  a  general
allusion  to  the  office  of  Podesta.^  As  we  have  observed,
however,  too  many  similar  allusions  occur  in  State  papers,
even  when  Florence  was  certainly  ruled  by  Consuls,  to
allow  us  to  draw  the  same  conclusion.  It  may  be  that
Florence  had  a  Podesta  even  earlier  than  1193,  but  until
we  find  some  document  specifying  the  name  of  a  person
filling  that  office,  we  cannot  venture  to  assert  it  as  a  fact.

At  any  rate,  the  institution  of  the  new  magistracy  was
preceded  by  an  increased  influx  of  nobles  within  the  city
walls.  This,  indeed,  was  one  of  the  chief  causes  of  the
change.  Continual  proofs  to  this  effect  are  afforded  by
contemporary  documents,  and  confirmed  by  the  narratives
of  the  chroniclers.  The  pseudo  Brunetto  Latini  tells  us
that  in  11 92  the  Consuls  included  "  Messer  Tegrino  of

'  October  14,  1175  (Passignano),  **  Sub  potestate  consulum  Florenti-
norum  vel  Nuntio  Regis "  ;  July  5,  1 191  (Arch.  Capitolare,  347),  "  Sub
pena  Consulum  Florentie  vel  Potestatis";  April  15, 11 92  (Arch.  Capitolare,
449),  "  Sub  obligo  Potestatis  vel  Rectorum  pro  tempore  Florentie  existenti-
bus"  ;  November  7,  1192  (Passignano,  in  the  Church  of  St.  Biagio),"  Sub
obligo  Potestatis  in  hac  terra  existentis  "  (here  allusion  is  possibly  made
to  some  Podestk  of  the  contado) ;  May  9,  1193  (Passerini  documents  in
the  Florence  Archives),  "  Sub  obligo  Potestatis  vel  Consulum  Florenti-
norum  .  .  .  Actum  Florentie."  According  to  these  and  other  rolls
examined  by  me  in  the  Florence  Archives,  the  change  is  seen  to  have
been  carried  out  in  a  regular  and  steady  manner.  The  ancient  formulas
reappear  from  time  to  time.

'  "  Inquisitis  florentinis  Consulibus,  vel  florentina  Potestate,  sive
Rectore  vel  Dominatore  .  .  .  florentini  Consules  vel  florentina  Potestate
sive  Rector  vel  Dominator"  (Santini,  i.  doc.  xiv).

the  Counts  Guidi,  *  paladin  '  in  Florence,  and  Chianni  de'
Fifanti."  Now,  to  find  a  count  and  count  palatine  or
paladine  among  the  Florentine  Consuls  is  an  absolutely
new  thing.  The  same  writer  also  says  that  in  the  same
year  "  a  decree  was  issued  in  Florence  that  the  Counts
Guidi  and  the  Counts  Alberti  and  the  Counts  da  Certaldo,
Ubaldini  et  Figiovanni,  Pazzi  and  Ubertini,  the  Counts  of
Panago,  and  many  other  nobles,  being  citizens,  were  to
dwell  in  the  city  of  Florence  during  four  months  of  the
year."  However  much  or  little  value  this  chronicler
may  have,  his  statement  agrees  with  the  information  found
in  documents,  and  explains  the  origin  of  the  new  magistra-
ture.  Assuredly  the  nobles  cannot  have  relished  being
subject  to  the  popular  consular  government,  against  which
they  had  struggled  since  the  year  1 177,  and  must  have
particularly  disliked  being  under  the  jurisdiction  of  persons
they  deemed  their  inferiors  in  rank  and  dignity.  Besides,
as  the  elements  composing  the  mass  of  the  citizens  became
more  heterogeneous,  thus  increasing  the  danger  of  civil
war,  so  much  the  more  the  possibility  of  being  judged  by
their  political  adversaries  must  have  seemed  unbearable  to
them.  Hence  the  need  was  felt  of  a  new  magistrature  of
a  different  and,  preferably,  of  an  aristocratic  character,
and  an  Imperial  institution,  such  as  that  of  the  Podesta,
was  chosen  for  a  model.  The  holder  of  this  office  is  no
mere  judge,  as  many  believed  and  recorded  ;  he  is  the  posi-
tive head  and  representative  of  the  Commune  ;  he  signs
treaties,  commands  the  army,  and  fills  the  place  of  the
Consuls.

In  fact,  when  on  July  14,  1193,  the  Castle  of  Trebbio
made  submission  to  Florence,  the  Commune  was  officially
represented  by  Gherardo  Caponsacchi  Potestas  Florentie  et
eius  consiliarii,  together  with  the  seven  rectors  of  the
headships  (Cafitudini)  of  the  guilds. ^     The  councillors,

156  FIRST  WARS  AND  FIRST  REFORMS.

whose  names  are  inserted  in  the  document,  are  likewise
seven,  and  almost  all  of  consular  houses  ;  two,  indeed,  are
nobles — namely,  a  Count  Arrigo  (perhaps  of  Capraia)
and  a  Tegghiaio  Bundelmonti.  It  seems  certain  that
Consuls  were  again  chosen  in  11 94,  since  the  pseudo
Brunetto  Latini  names  two,  one  of  whom  was  an  Uberti.
In  1 195  a  Podesta  reappears  in  the  person  of  Rainerius
de  Gaetano^  cum  suis  consiliariis,  among  whom  a  Consul
iustitiae  is  included.^  It  may  be  considered  a  certainty
that  these  councillors,  whose  number  is  continually  varying
in  the  documents,  were  no  other  than  the  Consuls,  who
survived  in  this  transitorv  form  for  some  time,  with  the
Podesta  as  their  chief.  Together  with  him  they  represent
the  Commune,  sometimes  even  without  him.  But  by
degrees  their  importance  diminishes,  while  that  of  the
Podesta  is  increased.  In  short,  there  is  a  period  of  trans-
formation during  which  the  new,  and  as  yet,  ill-defined
form  of  government  alternates  with  that  of  the  Consuls.

In  1200  the  Podesta  is  no  longer  a  Florentine,  but  a
foreigner,  and  already  represents  the  government,  unaided
by  councillors,  who  have  disappeared  altogether  in  1207 —
namely,  when  the  government  has  assumed  its  definite
shape.  Or,  to  express  it  more  accurately,  their  function
was  continually  changed  and  their  number  increased,  until
they  were  converted  into  a  special  council  of  the  whole
city,  beside  the  ancient  council  or  senate  that  was
changed  into  a  general  council.  On  arriving  at  that
time  we  shall  find  the  government  represented  by  the
Podesta  and  two  councils,  sitting  either  separately  or
jointly,  and  styled  in  the  latter  case  the  general  and
special  council.  Thus  the  consular  office  may  be  con-
sidered to  have  been  altogether  extinguished.  In  fact,
excepting    one   final    attempt  in    121 1   and    1212,  when

Consuls  were  once  more  elected,  we  never  meet  with  them
again.  What  we  have  related  will  make  it  easier  to
understand  why  the  chroniclers  attribute  the  origin  of  the
Podesta  to  various  dates.  The  pseudo  Brunetto  Latini
makes  the  office  begin  in  1200 — namely,  the  year  when  it
was  first  held  by  a  foreigner,  and  alien  birth  considered  an
indispensable  qualification  for  the  post.  Therefore,  before
that  time,  the  chronicler  seems  to  regard  the  Podesta
chiefly  as  a  head  Consul.^  We  can  also  understand  why
Villani,  on  the  contrary,  should  have  dated  the  origin  of
the  office  from  1207  This,  in  fact,  was  the  year  in
which  it  assumed  a  really  definite  shape,  since  the  Podesta
was  not  only  a  foreigner,  but  appears  unescorted  by
councillors.  Nevertheless,  Villani  makes  a  mistake  in
representing  him  as  a  magistrate  chosen  for  the  sole  pur-
pose of  administering  justice  more  impartially,  and  in
adding  that  *'  the  signory  of  the  Consuls  did  not  cease
then,  inasmuch  as  they  continued  to  hold  power  over  all
other  affairs  of  the  Commune."  He  makes  two  blunders
here,  but  the  second  is  little  more  than  a  simple  ana-
chronism. In  fact,  although  his  statement  cannot  be
true  as  regards  1207,  it  may  have  been  at  least  partially
true  with  reference  to  the  preceding  years,  when  the
Consuls  still  survived  their  own  decease,  as  it  were,  in  the
guise  of  councillors  to  the  Podesta.

government  between  1196  and  1199.^  But  just  at  that
time  an  event  of  considerable  importance  worked  a
radical  change  in  the  general  policy  of  Tuscany,  and
is  accordingly  worthy  of  notice.  The  Emperor  Frederic
I.  died  on  September  27,  1197,  and  his  death  led  first
to  the  abandonment  and  then  to  the  total  ruin  of  the
Imperial  system  he  had  so  persistently  striven  to  establish
throughout  central  Italy.  The  people  of  San  Miniato
destroyed  the  fortress  held  by  the  Germans,  and
subsequently  the  walls  of  St.  Genesio.2  The  Florentines
bought  back  the  Castle  of  Montegrossoli,  which  had
been  re-occupied  and  fortified  by  nobles,  who  proved  very
troublesome.  3  After  this  Florence  set  a  greater  under-
taking on  foot,  by  forming  a  league  of  the  Tuscan  cities
against  the  Empire.  It  was  finally  arranged  at  St.  Genesio
on  November  11,  1 197,  when  first  the  Lucchese,  and  then
the  Florentines,  Siennese,  the  people  of  San  Miniato,  and
the  Bishop  of  Volterra  made  oath  to  maintain  it,  and  the
solemnity  of  the  occasion  was  enhanced  by  the  presence
of  two  cardinals  of  the  Church.  The  main  terms  of  the
treaty  were,  an  alliance  for  the  common  defence  against
all  opponents  of  the  League,  and  a  pledge  that  neither
peace  nor  truce  should  be  made  "  cum  aliquo  Imperatore

'  Florence  Archives,  "  Bullettone,"  c.  131.  July  10,  1196  :  "  Dominus

League,  quoted  later  on,  and  Hartwig,  ii.  194.

'  In  the  year  1 197,  Paolino  Fieri  tells  us  :  "  San  Miniato  al  Tedesco,  or
rather  its  fortress,  was  destroyed."  In  1198,  he  tells  how  "  San  Genesio
was  pulled  down  by  the  inhabitants"  {terrazzani),  who  then  returned  to
the  hill-top,  and  rebuilt  San  Miniato.  Villani  (v.  21)  says  that  San
Miniato  was  destroyed,  and  its  inhabitants  came  down  to  St.  Genesio
in  the  plain.  Vide  also  the  "  Annales,"  ii.,  and  the  Neap.  Cod.,  ad  annum.

THE  TUSCAN  LEAGUE.  159

vel  Rege  seu  Principe,  Duce  vel  Marchione,"  without  the
consent  of  the  Rectors  of  the  said  League.  It  was  also
agreed  to  attack  all  cities,  towns,  counts,  or  bishops  refus-
ing to  join  the  alliance  when  requested  so  to  do.^  What
was  the  pressing  danger  ?  Why  this  alliance  against  the
Empire  at  the  moment  when  it  was  no  longer  a  source  of
alarm  ?  There  is  one  stipulation  that  best  explains  the
real  object  in  view.  It  is  to  the  effect  that  castles,  towns,
and  small  domains  were  only  to  be  admitted  to  the  League
as  dependents  of  the  legitimate  owners  of  the  territory
whereon  these  castles  or  domains  might  be  situated  ;  but  a
single  exception  was  made  in  favour  of  Poggibonsi,^
because  its  dominion  was  disputed  by  many  claimants.
Montepulciano  was  to  be  admitted  as  a  dependence  of
Sienna  whenever  that  city  should  be  able  to  prove  its  right
of  dominion.

It  seems  clear  from  all  this  that  the  genuine  purpose
of  the  League  was  to  take  advantage  of  the  emperor's
decease  in  order  to  secure  to  the  cities  the  complete
possession  of  their  respective  territories.  To  this  end
it  was  necessary  that  Tuscany  should  be  united,  and  con-
sequently adherence  to  the  League  was  to  be,  as  far  as
possible,  obligatory.  Its  subsequent  documents  leave  no
doubt  as  to  the  true  aim  in  view  ;  indeed,  they  furnish
very  ample  proof  that  Florence  had  promoted  the  League,
in  order  that  all  Tuscany  might  aid  her  to  regain  speedy
possession  of  the  contado.  But,  although  the  League  was
against  the  Empire,  it  was  by  no  means  intended  for  the
defence  of  the  Pope,  since  it  utterly  disregarded  his  pre-
tensions to  Matilda's  inheritance.     For  refusing  to  recog-

and  also  some  of  those  at  Sienna  which  are  more  complete  and  correct  at
certain  points.

nise  any  emperor,  king,  duke,  or  margrave,  without  the
approval  of  the  Roman  Church,  a  proviso  was  added
showing  that  should  the  Pope  desire  to  join  the  League,
he  must  accept  its  terms  in  order  to  win  admittance.
Should  he  request  assistance  to  reconquer  his  own  territories,
everything  was  to  be  done  according  to  the  orders  of  the
Rectors  of  the  League.  But  should  the  territory  he  wished
to  reconquer  be  already  in  the  hands  of  the  communes,  or
of  any  of  the  allied  cities,  the  League  could  afford  him
no  help.  It  was  impossible  to  speak  more  clearly.  Ac-
cordingly, when  Innocent  III.  became  Pope,  early  in  1 198,
we  soon  find  him  manifesting  much  disapproval  of  the
conduct  of  the  League,  in  spite  of  being  adverse  to  the
Empire  and  favourable  to  the  national  Italian  spirit.

At  Castel  Fiorentino,  on  December  4,  11 97,  the
Rectors  of  the  League  were  sworn  in.  First  among  them
were  the  Bishop  of  Volterra  and  the  Florentine  Consul
Acerbo,  who  was  practically  the  head,  although  that  title
was  accorded  to  the  bishop  by  reason  of  his  ecclesiastical
rank.  For  the  moment  Pisa  and  Pistoia  held  back  ;  but
these  and  other  Tuscan  cities  had  retained  the  right  of
adhering  to  the  League. ^  Arezzo  had  already  joined  on
the  2nd  of  December,  Count  Guido  gave  his  oath  on
February  5,  1198,  and  Count  Alberto  on  the  seventh  of
the  same  month.  Nevertheless,  in  signing  the  second
of  these  two  treaties,  the  Florentines  expressly  reserved
their  right  to  attach  Semifonte,  and  procure  the  submission
of  the  Alberti  estates  of  Certaldo  and  Mangone,  even  by
force    if  required.^      Thus   many   other    adhesions    were

13  and  14,  1 197.  The  document  in  Santini,  i.  doc.  xxiii.  gives  the  names
of  sixteen  Consuls  and  133  councillors  who  took  the  oath.  In  a  pre-
ceding document,  also  relating  to  February  5  and  17,  1198,  there  are  the
names  of  ten  Consuls,  but  three  of  them  are  not  the  same  on  both  days,
so  that  there  must  have  been  more  than  twelve  Consuls  in  February,

obtained  by  means  of  stipulations  virtually  implying  acts
of  submission  to  Florence.

This  was  the  moment  chosen  by  the  newly  elected  Pope
Innocent,  soon  after  his  consecration  in  the  same  month  of
February,  to  write  to  the  two  cardinals  who  had  witnessed
the  oath  to  the  League,  stating  that  on  many  points  he
considered  the  said  treaty  "  nee  utilitatem  contineat,  nee
sapiat  honestatem,"  inasmuch  as  it  neglected  the  fact  of  the
Duchy  of  Tuscany  appertaining  to  the  Church,  "  ad  ius  et
dominium  Ecclesiae  Romanae  pertineat."  He  intended,
therefore,  to  enforce  his  rights.  If  the  members  of  the
League  submitted  to  him,  he  would  compel  the  Pisans,
under  threat  of  interdict,  to  likewise  join  them  against
the  Empire  ;  otherwise  he  would  leave  them  at  liberty  to
do  as  they  chose.  ^  But  as  no  attention  was  paid  to  him,
he  had  to  make  a  virtue  of  necessity  and  considerably
lower  his  tone. 2  Some  slight  concessions,  though  of  what
nature  is  unknown,  seem,  however,  to  have  been  made  to
him,  for  afterwards,  when  writing  to  the  Pisans,  he
appeared  to  be  better  satisfied,  and  urged  them  to  join
the  League.  It  is,  however,  certain  that  they  persisted  in
their  refusal,  and  although  the  Pope,  grown  shrewder  by
experience,  afterwards  became  a  declared  and  energetic
champion  of  the  League  against    the    Empire,  this  fact

this  confirms  our  previous  hypothesis  that,  on  the  great  occasion  of  the
League,  all  or  part  of  the  withdrawing  Consuls  remained  in  office  with
those  just  elected.  Nor  is  this  a  solitary  instance.  On  April  2,  1212,
the  Commune  of  Prato,  in  arranging  a  treaty  with  Florence,  sent  three
Consules  veteri,  and  three  Consules  novi  eiusde^n  terre  to  conclude  it.

only  availed  to  augment  his  moral  and  political  influence,
without  winning  him  a  single  handsbreadth  of  territory,  or
enabling  him  to  enforce  any  one  of  his  pretended  rights
over  Tuscany.  The  Florentines,  on  the  contrary,  profited
more  and  more  by  this  state  of  things.  On  April  lo,
1 198,  Figline  entered  the  League,  not  only  made
submission  to  Florence,  but  paid  a  yearly  tribute  also  ^  ;
and  on  the  nth  of  May  Certaldo  agreed  to  identical
terms.2  The  Republic  persevered  in  the  course  it  had
marked  out  with  equal  shrewdness  and  energy.  It
allowed  the  nobles  to  take  an  increasing  part  in  the
government,  so  as  to  secure  their  hearty  co-operation
in  achieving  the  aim  it  had  in  view  The  same  Count
Arrigo  da  Capraia,  who  in  11 93  was  on  the  council
of  Podesta  Caponsacchi,  was  actually  promoted  to  the
consulship  in  11 99.3  Finally,  in  1200,  a  foreigner  was
elected  Podesta,4  in  the  person  of  Paganello  Porcari  of
Lucca,  a  measure  that,  as  we  have  already  noted,  the
nobles  had  long  desired  to  carry  out.     And  as   Porcari

The  second  alludes  to  the  chief  Consuls  :  "  Comandamenta  Consulum

third  informs  us  (pp.  43  and  44)  that  the  oath  was  sworn:  "  In  Florentia,

="  Santini,  i.  doc.  xxvi.  Obedience  was  sworn  to  the  Consuls  or  Rectors

little  savour  of  the  more  democratic  temper  of  former  times.

In  Villani  (v.  26)  he  is  wrongly  styled  Count  Arrigo  della  Tosa.
The  Delia  Tosa  family  were  not  counts.  The  pseudo  Brunetto  Latini
speaks  of  him  in  an  undated  paragraph,  anterior  to  his  record  of  1200,
as  '  Messer  Arrigo,  count  of  Capraia."

*  As  we  have  stated,  it  seems  to  be  for  this  reason  that  the  pseudo
Brunetto  Latini  dates  the  office  of  Podestk  from  this  moment  :  "A  novel
thing  was  done,  and  for  the  first  time  a  Potestade  was  elected  in  Florence,
from  jealousy  of  the  Consuls,  the  which  Potestade  was  Paganello  Porcaro

showed  energy  and  daring  In  the  conduct  of  the  war
he  was  again  chosen  the  following  year.  Then,  in
February,  1201,  Count  Alberto  made  oath  to  cede  the
height  of  Semifonte,  with  its  fortress  and  walls,  to  the
Florentines  ;  and  to  assist  them,  whenever  required,  to
gain  possession  of  Colle,  Certaldo,  and  the  town  of  Semi-
fonte. ^  The  Bishop  of  Volterra  likewise  made  oath  to
assist  them  in  these  campaigns. 2  All  this  seemed  to  come
about  as  an  inherent  consequence  of  the  terms  of  the
League,  and  before  long  the  allies,  finding  themselves
reduced  to  serve  the  interests  of  Florence  alone,  naturally
began  to  show  signs  of  weariness  and  suspicion.  But,
heedless  of  all  else,  the  Commune  made  ready  for  the
expedition  against  Semifonte,  for  which  all  these  treaties
had  paved  the  way.

Florence  had  long  contemplated  the  seizure  of  that
stronghold,  for,  owing  to  its  strategic  advantages  and  the
ease  with  which  the  position  could  be  reinforced  by
friendly  neighbours,  it  had  been  a  thorn  in  her  side.
Accordingly  the  now  haughty  Republic  determined  to
make  an  end  of  it.  We  have  already  related  how  in
1 1 84  Count  Alberto  had   been  compelled  to  accept  the

'  Santini,  i.  doc.  xxvii.  (February  12  and  23,  1200)  ;  doc.  xxviii.
(February  12  and  19)  ;  doc.  xxix.  (February  12  and  23,  and  March  25).
In  these  papers  the  Podestk  is  always  mentioned  with  the  councillors,
and  the  office  of  the  Consuls  is  also  invariably  recorded  :  "Sive  parabola
Potestatis  et  Consiliariorum  vel  Consulum  sive  Rectorum  Florentie"  (p.
49).  "A  Potestate  vel  Consiliariis  eius,  sive  a  Consulibus  Florentie  vel
Rectoribus"  (p.  48).  In  a  posterior  document  (Santini,  i.  doc.  xxxvii.,
dated  August  14,  1201),  we  find  the  councillors  representing  the
Podestk  ;  "  Sitio  filio  condam  Butrighelli,  Melio  filio  Catalan!  Consiliarii
domini  Potestatis  Florentie,  recipient!  {sic)  vice  et  nomine  dicte  Potes-
tatis et  totius  Comunis  Florentie"  (p.  72).  These  councillors  did  not  yet
form  a  special  council,  but  were  on  the  way  to  it,  since  the  council  or
senate  of  the  city  being  already  called  the  general  council,  the  existence
of  a  special  one  is  implied  :  "  In  Florentia,  in  ecclesia  S.  Reparate,

same  terms  exacted  from  the  people  of  Pogna  in  1 1 8  2 —
namely,  to  give  his  solemn  promise  to  build  no  defences.
Nevertheless,  profiting  by  the  arrival  of  Frederic  I.  and
the  difficulties  in  which  Florence  was  then  involved,  he
had  presently  erected  the  Castle  of  Semifonte  on  the
Petrognano  rock,  and  Florence  had  never  forgiven  this
offence.  He  had  also  assumed  the  title  of  Comes  de
Summofonte.  Near  the  castle  a  town  had  sprung  up,  and,
as  many  sought  refuge  there  from  neighbouring  places
conquered  and  taxed  by  Florence,  its  population  had
rapidly  increased.  Indeed  there  was  already  this  rhyme
afloat  in  the  contado  :

•'  Firenze,  fatti  in  Ik,
Che  Semifonte  si  fa  cittk.*"

It  was  for  these  reasons  that  the  Republic  so  persistently
tried  to  secure  pledges  of  help  from  its  neighbours  by  the
numerous  treaties  to  which  reference  has  been  made,  and
likewise  by  others  concluded  through  the  efforts  of  the
energetic  Podesta.  But  Sienna  had  still  to  be  reckoned
with,  and  Sienna  might  do  good  service  to  the  hostile
Alberto,  who  was  already  prepared  for  defence.  Accord-
ingly the  Florentines  signed  an  alliance  with  that  state
on  March  29,  1201,  promising  their  aid  against  Montal-
cino,  which  showed  as  threatening  a  front  to  Sienna  as  the
Semifonte  position  towards  their  own  city. 2  Also  Colle
was  made  to  swear  to  accord  no  help  to  the  people  of
Semifonte.3     Thereupon  the  war  finally  began.

'  It  may  be  roughly  rendered  :

"Florence,  get  out  of  the  way,
Semifonte's  a  city  to-day."

"  Santini,  i.  doc.  xxxiv.

3  This  treaty  was  concluded  April  27,  1201  ;  about  five  hundred
inhabitants  of  Colle  swearing  adhesion  to  it  on  the  28th,  29th,  and  30th
of  April.     Santini,  i.  docs.  xxxv.  and  xxxvi.


SIEGE  AND  SURRENDER  OF  SEMIFONTE.     165

The  chronicler  Sanzanome,  who  witnessed  it,  declares,
with  his  habitual  exaggeration,  that  it  lasted  five  years,
but  he  may  have  counted  in  all  the  preliminary  skirmishes.^
At  any  rate,  it  was  a  hard  struggle,  for,  treaties  notwith-
standing, Semifonte  received  help  from  all  its  neighbours,
whose  jealous  dread  of  Florence  had  considerably  increased.
Then,  too,  owing  to  the  strength  of  its  position  and  the
ability  of  Scoto,  its  valiant  Podesta,  the  castle  opposed  so
vigorous  a  resistance  to  the  beleaguring  army  surrounding
it  on  all  sides,  that  the  Florentines,  seeing  no  hope  of
winning  it  by  force,  called  treason  to  their  aid.  A  certain
Gonella,  with  some  other  fugitives,  escaped  from  an
adjoining  territory,  had  taken  refuge  in  the  castle,  and
been  entrusted  with  the  defence  of  the  Bagnuolo  tower.
This  man  made  use  of  his  post  to  betray  the  place  to  the
enemy.  But  at  the  moment  that  he  and  his  comrades
were  in  the  act  of  opening  the  gate,  the  defenders  of  Semi-
fonte fell  on  them  with  fury  and  killed  them  all.  Never-
theless, the  evil  deed  had  done  its  work,  for  Semifonte
was  speedily  forced  to  surrender.  Even  if  this  was  not
brought  about  by  treason  alone,  as  Villani  asserts  (v.  30),
the  betrayal  of  the  tower  undoubtedly  contributed  to  that
result.  In  fact,  on  February  20,  1202,  the  Consuls,  then
returned  to  office  in  Florence,  granted  a  perpetual  exemp-
tion from  all  dues  or  taxes  to  the  descendants  of  Gonella
and  his  companions  fallen  in  the  cause  of  the  Republic. 2
The  same  year,  on  the  3rd  of  April,  the  terms  of  the
castle's  surrender  were  subscribed  and  sworn.  The  Floren-
tines assured  pardon,   protection,   and  the  return   of  all

comrades,  "qui  mortui  fuere  in  turre  de  Bagunolo  et  in  muris  apud
Summumfontem,  in  servitio  Communis  Florentie."  Vide  also  in  Hartwig,

prisoners  to  the  people  of  Semifonte,  but  the  latter  were
bound  to  demolish  their  fortress  and  walls  ;  were  to
desert  the  hill  and  settle  in  the  plain ;  and  all  save  the
soldiery  and  the  churches  were  to  pay  a  yearly  tax  of
twenty-six  denari  on  every  hearth.  ^

The  Pope  expostulated  strongly  with  the  Florentines
for  their  cruelty  towards  Semifonte,  but  after  sending  him
a  letter  of  justification  in  reply,  the  Consuls  continued  to
follow  their  own  course,  and  picked  a  quarrel  with  the
Siennese.2  The  point  of  dispute  was  the  Castle  of  Tor-
nano,  in  the  Paterno  valley.  Florence  wished  to  get
possession  of  it,  and  the  Siennese  declared  that  it  was  not
theirs  to  give,  seeing  that  it  was  the  property  of  inde-
pendent lords.  Thereupon  the  Florentines  set  to  work
in  their  usual  way,  by  persuading  Montepulciano,  a  large
town  belonging  to  Sienna,  to  swear  submission  to  them,
and  also  promise  an  annual  tribute.3  Accordingly,  war
would  have  broken  out  at  once,  but  for  the  intervention
of  Ogerio,  the  Podesta  of  Poggibonsi.  Being  accepted  as
arbiter,  he  carefully  studied  the  question  of  border  lines,
and  conscientiously  defined  them.  His  verdict  was  given
on  June  4,  1203.4  According  to  the  boundaries  traced
by  Ogerio,  Florence  retained  the  whole  of  the  Fiesolan
and  Florentine  contado^  and  the  valley  of  Paterno  was

comprised  in  these  limits.  The  Siennese  were  to  do  their
best  to  persuade  the  lords  of  the  castle  to  cede  that  as
well.  Both  sides  agreed  to  this  arrangement ;  ^  it  was
scrupulously  respected  by  the  Siennese,  and  on  May  15,
1204,  it  was  sanctioned  by  Pope  Innocent  III.,  at  the
express  desire  of  the  Florentines.^  Nevertheless,  the
latter  continued  their  secret  practices  with  Montepulciano,
and  on  the  30th  and  31st  of  May  induced  that  town  to
renew  its  oath  of  offensive  and  defensive  alliance  against
Sienna.3  As  soon  as  this  became  known,  there  were  fresh
complaints,  fresh  protests  from  the  Siennese.  They  brought
the  affair  before  the  League,  and  the  Rectors  of  the  same
were  expressly  assembled  at  San  Quirico  di  Osenna,
April  5,  1205,  under  the  presidency  of  the  Bishop  of
Volterra,  the  Florentines  and  Aretines  having  declined  to
appear.  By  the  examination  of  witnesses,  it  was  clearly
proved  that  Montepulciano  appertained  to  the  Siennese.4
We  do  not  know  whether  the  verdict  was  then  pronounced,
nor  do  we  know  the  final  result  of  the  quarrel.  But  it
seems  clear  that  from  this  moment  the  League  was
virtually  dissolved,  and  by  the  act  of  the  Florentines,  its
original  initiators.  Their  primary  object  was  now  achieved
in  the  main,  and  henceforth  they  could  expect  nothing
from  their  allies  save  impediments  to  the  fulfilment  of
their  ulterior  designs.  For,  more  or  less,  all  distrusted
their  ambition,  and  were  tired  of  playing  the  part  of
passive  tools.

'  On  the  days  4th,  7th,  and  8th  of  June,  the  Bishop  and  Commune  of
Sienna  gave  up  all  that  was  due  to  Florence,  in  accordance  with  the
verdict.  Santini,  i.  doc.  xlviii.  On  the  6th  of  the  same  month  one
hundred  and  fifty  Siennese  councillors  swore  observance  to  the  terms.

But  the  Florentine  Consuls  allowed  nothing  to  check
their  course  of  action,  and  quarrelled  next  with  the  Counts
of  Capraia  owning  a  castle  of  the  same  name  on  the
right  bank  of  the  Arno,  near  the  Pistoian  frontier.  In
conjunction  with  the  Pistoiese,  these  nobles  could  easily
bar  the  Arno  against  the  Florentines.  Accordingly,
before  this,  in  1203,  the  latter  had  deemed  it  well  to
erect  another  castle  on  the  opposite  bank  at  a  place  called
Malborghetto.  The  very  significant  name  of  Montelupo
that  they  gave  to  the  new  building  was  sufficiently
expressive  of  its  purpose.  In  fact,  men  already  repeated
the  saying,  *'  To  destroy  this  goat,  there  needs  a  wolf."  ^
This  affair  also  would  have  provoked  strife  had  not  the
Florentines,  with  their  accustomed  diplomatic  subtlety,
profited  by  the  friendly  offices  of  the  Lucchese  to  turn  it
to  their  own  advantage,  and  avoid  coming  to  blows.  In
fact,  a  treaty  was  arranged  in  June,  1204,  by  which
Florence  was  bound  to  leave  the  right  bank  of  the  river
unmolested,  and  the  Counts  of  Capraia  to  respect  the
left  bank  of  the  same. 2  And  before  long  the  count
decided  to  swear  alliance  and  fealty  to  the  Florentines,
together  with  his  dependents,  all  of  whom,  excepting  the
soldiery,  became  subject  to  a  yearly  hearth  tax  of  twenty-
six  denari.  He  also  ceded  his  castle  and  other  posses-
sions on  the  left  side  of  the  Arno,  near  Montelupo,  being
likewise  pledged  to  the  defence  of  this  fort.3

true,  it  must  be  concluded  that  his  nomination  had  been
also  stipulated  in  the  treaty. 2  In  the  ensuing  year  the
consular  government  seems  to  have  been  resumed,  but  in
1207  we  come  at  last  to  the  genuine  Podesta  of  foreign
birth,  in  the  shape  of  Gualfredotto  Grasselli  of  Milan,  who
henceforth  represented  the  Commune  without  requiring
the  assistance  of  his  consiliarii.  Grasselli,  too,  was  re-
elected the  following  year,  to  enable  him  to  carry  on  the
campaigns  the  Florentines  had  planned  with  so  much
ardour  some  time  before.  An  occasion  for  renewing
hostilities  was  not  long  delayed.  The  Montepulciano
question  had  become  angrier ;  and  accordingly  the  Siennese,
considering  that  territory  to  be  theirs  by  right,  resolved  to
attack  it.  In  the  certainty  of  being  reinforced,  Monte-
pulciano made  a  most  obstinate  defence  ;  and  the  Floren-
tines, after  waiting  awhile,  also  recurred  to  arms  in  1207.
In  co-operation  with  Lombard,  Romagnol,  and  Aretine
allies,  they  marched  with  their  Carroccio  to  the  assault  of
the  Castle  of  Montalto  della  Berardenga,  between  the  rivers

Paganiti  sexcalcorum  Comunis  Florentie."  Even  the  office  of  sexcalcus
is  new  (it  is  also  mentioned  in  another  document  of  the  30-315!  of  May,
in  Santini,  i.  xlvi.),  and  seems  to  us  a  sign  of  the  change  tending  to  a
more  aristocratic  form  of  government  in  Florence.  The  communal  oath
sworn  on  October  29,  1204  (Santini,  i.  doc.  liv.)  began  thus,  "  Hec  sunt
sacramenta,  quae  Potestas  et  Consules  Comunis  et  Consules  militum,
mercatorum  et  Priores  Artium  et  generate  Consilium,  ad  sonum  campane
coadunatum,  fecerunt  Guidoni  Borgognoni  comiti  et  filiis  et  Caprolen-
sibus."  The  Consuls  took  the  oath,  not  the  Podestk,  for  there  was  none,
although  nominally  heading  the  formula.

Podestk.  Vide  Hartwig,  ii.  197.  But  the  documents  of  this  year  only

Ambra  and  Ombrone,  which  the  Siennese  had  guarded  on
all    sides   with   their    Pistoian,    Lucchese,    and    Orvietan
friends.     These  were   all  routed  on  the   20th  of  June,
leaving  many  prisoners  in  the  enemy's  hands.     Accord-
ing to  Paolino  Fieri  the  number  taken  was   1,254.     The
castle  was  destroyed,  but  the  war  went  on,  notwithstanding
the  Pope's  efforts  to  bring  about  a  peace.    The  Florentines
then  made  a  furious  attack  on  the  Castle  of  Rigoniagno,
and  when  the  scaling  ladders  broke  down  they  climbed
on  one  another's  shoulders  and  thus  won  the  walls.     The
capture  of  this  stronghold    made  them   masters  of  the
Ombrone    valley.^       Thereupon    (February,    1208)    the
Siennese   were    forced    to   accept    peace    on    very    hard
terms.     By  the  treaty  concluded  between  the   13th  and
20th  of  October,2  they  were  pledged  to  yield  all  their
possessions  at  Poggibonsi,  to  cede  Tornano  and  its  tower,
to  observe  the  boundaries  adjudged  by  Ogerio,  in  every
direction,  and  to  leave  Montepulciano  unmolested.     The
prisoners  on  either  side  were  exchanged.

But  this  war  already  betokens  the  advent  of  a  new
period  in  Florentine  history.  The  conquest  of  the  contado
was  no  longer  in  question,  for  the  Republic  already  pos-
sessed it  in  full.  With  the  growing  prosperity  born  of  its
numerous  victories,  the  city  had  now  to  open  roads  for  its
vast  commerce.  It  was  not  only  the  vagueness  of  their
respective  frontiers  and  the  wish  to  enlarge  them  that
caused  Sienna  and  Florence  to  be  continually  at  strife  ;  it
was  their  commercial  rivalry  in  the  markets  of  Italy,  and
especially  as  regarded  the  trade  with  Rome  ;   this  near

neighbour  having  become,  through  the  widespread  rela-
tions of  the  Church,  the  principal  centre  of  financial  affairs
in  the  civilised  world.  For  some  time  past  it  had  been
the  aim  of  Florence  to  obtain  a  monoply  of  these  affairs,
and  this  was  one  reason  why  she  had  always  adhered  to
the  Guelphs.  She  had  had  frequent  disputes  with  Arezzo,
Volterra,  and  above  all  with  Sienna,  as  being  the  most
powerful  city  on  the  road  to  Rome.  So  the  two  rivals
were  perpetually  stirred  to  fresh  and  fiercer  strife.  So,  too,
before  long,  the  irresistible  need  of  Florence  for  free  com-
munication with  the  sea  became  the  chief  cause  of  her
equally  long  and  sanguinary  wars  with  Pisa,  the  city
barring  her  way  to  the  coast.  But  as  this  conflict  had
not  yet  begun,  the  subject  will  be  resumed  in  due  time.
In  fact,  the  peace  of  Sienna  was  followed  by  some  years  or
truce  with  foreign  foes,  although  there  was  little  peace
within  the  city,  where  the  seeds  of  civil  war  were  already
on  the  pomt  of  bursting  forth.

The  foreign  Podesta,  unattended  and  unchecked  by  the
former  councillor-consuls,  as  they  might  be  called,  has  now
become  a  settled  institution  ;  and,  save  for  their  brief
re-establishment  during  1211  and  1212,  the  Consuls,  as
already  related,  have  vanished  for  ever.  This  was
undeniably  a  triumph  for  the  patricians,  to  whom  the
working  people  had.  bent  for  the  nonce,  in  order  to  secure
their  co-operation  in  the  difficult  task  of  reducing  the
contado  to  submission.  The  achievement  of  this  conquest
gave  an  extraordinary  impulse  to  trade,  and  by  opening  an
increasingly  wide  field  for  commercial  enterprise,  induced
the  desire  to  develop  it  still  more.  Hence,  it  was  not  to
be  expected  that  a  republic  whose  prosperity  and  strength
were  wholly  based  on  its  industry  and  commerce,  could  or
would  be  satisfied,  in  the  long  run,  with  a  government
suited  to  nobles,  whose  constant  tendency  was  to  grow
stronger,   haughtier,  and    more  overbearing.     From  this


172

moment,  therefore,  a  struggle  between  the  people  and  the
patricians  {grandi)  was  inevitable.  The  long  series  of
civil  wars,  lacerating  the  city  and  staining  its  stones  with
blood,  is  in  fact  on  the  point  of  beginning.

FTER  the  office  of  Podesta  had  been
permanently  established  in  1207,  its
main  favourers  and  promoters,  the  aristo-
crats, became  more  daring,  and  forming
a  military  organisation,  of  which  the
Podesta  was  the  head,  took  a  more
active  part  in  all  wars  abroad.  Everything  seemed  pro-
gressing rapidly  and  well,  when  the  Buondelmonti  affair
in  1 2 1 5  caused  an  outbreak  of  civil  war.  Dissension  was
already  lurking  among  certain  of  the  nobles,  and  particu-
larly between  the  Buondelmonti  on  the  one  hand,  the
Uberti  and  Fifanti  on  the  other,  either  side  numbering
many  adherents.  Accordingly,  in  the  hope  of  pacifying  the
dispute,  a  marriage  was  arranged  between  Bundelmonte
Buondelmonti  and  a  maiden  of  the  Amidei  house.  But
when  all  the  preliminaries  were  concluded,  the  wife  of
Forese  Donati  called  Buondelmonti  to  her  and  said  :  "  Oh  !
shameful  knight,  to  take  to  wife  a  woman  of  the  Uberti  and
Fifanti.    'Twere  better  and  worthier  to  choose  this  bride."

'  This  chapter  was  originally  published  in  the  Politecnico  of  Milan,
numbers  for  July  and  September,  1866.

So  saying,  she  pointed  to  her  own  daughter.  Buondelmonti
accepted  the  offer,  and,  forsaking  his  betrothed,  speedily-
married  the  girl.  Thereupon  the  kinsfolk  and  friends
of  the  deserted  maiden  assembled  in  the  Amidei  palace
and  vowed  to  avenge  her  wrongs.  It  was  then  that  Mosca
Lamberti  turned  to  those  charged  to  execute  revenge,
saying,  "  Whoever  deals  a  light  blow  or  wound,  may
prepare  for  his  own  grave."  And  then,  to  show  that  the
quarrel  was  to  the  death,  he  added  the  memorable  words  :
*' Once  done,  'tis  done  with  "("  Coj<2 /<2//<^,  cafo  ha'').
So  bloodshed  was  ordained.

It  was  the  Easter  Day  of  12 15.  The  handsome  young
knight  Buondelmonti,  elegantly  attired  and  with  a  wreath
on  his  head,  mounted  his  white  horse  and  crossed  from
Oltrarno  by  the  old  bridge.  He  had  reached  the  statue
of  Mars,  when  he  was  suddenly  attacked.  Schiatta  degli
Uberti  hurled  him  to  the  ground  with  a  blow  from  his
mace,  and  the  other  conspirators  quickly  fell  upon  him
and  severed  his  veins  with  their  knives.  Afterwards
the  corpse  was  placed  on  a  bier,  the  bride  supporting  the
head  of  her  murdered  husband,  and  both  carried  in
procession  round  the  city,  to  move  men  to  fresh  deeds  of
hatred  and  revenge.  ^  And  this  was  the  beginning  of  the
series  of  internecine  wars,  from  which  many  chroniclers
date  the  origin  of  the  Guelph  and  Ghibelline  factions  in
Florence.  No  modern  historian,  however,  will  be  apt  to
attribute  so  vast  an  importance  to  a  private  feud,  nor  to
believe  that  a  breach  of  promise  to  an  Amidei  maiden
could  be  the  real  primary  cause  of  the  party  strife  that
from  the  year  1177  had  already  more  than  once  drenched
the  city  in  blood.     Even  Villani,  although  considering  the

pseudo  Brunetto  Latini  {ad  annum),  and  by  Dino  Compagniat  the  begin-
ning of  his  Chronicle.  But  the  gist  is  the  same  in  all  three,  and  we  have
mainly  adhered  to  the  first  and  second  authorities,  whose  accounts  are
longer  and  more  detailed  than  that  of  Compagai.


RESULT  OF  THE  BUONDELMONTI  TRAGEDY.  175

Buondelmonti  affair  to  be  the  origin  of  the  Guelphs  and
Ghibellines,  is  careful  to  add  :  "  Nevertheless,  long  before
this,  the  noble  citizens  had  split  into  sects  and  into  the
said  parties,  by  reason  of  the  quarrels  and  disputes  between
the  Church  and  the  Empire." '  The  Buondelmonti
catastrophe,  with  all  the  private  enmities  it  involved,
undoubtedly  served  to  inflame  the  political  passions  of
two  already  existent  parties,  which  now,  in  the  days  of
Frederic  II.,  acquired  a  political  importance  of  a  far  wider
nature  by  their  connection  with  the  general  affairs  of  Italy.
It  was  only  then  that  the  parties  in  Florence  assumed  the
German  appellations  of  Guelphs  and  Ghibellines.  Also,  it
is  worthy  of  remark  that  July,  121 5,  was  the  date  of  the
second  Frederic's  state  progress  to  Aix  la  Chapelle,  to  be
crowned  king  of  Germany,  a  fact  of  some  significance,  as
regards  the  history  of  parties  in  Italy.  This  may  easily
explain  why  the  chroniclers  should  have  attributed  to  the
Buondelmonti  tragedy,  occurring  in  the  same  year,  the
origin  of  the  Guelphs  and  Ghibellines.  The  names  began
then  it  is  true,  but  the  parties  were  of  older  date.

Villani's  Chronicle  (v.  39)  now  gives  a  list  of  the  prin-
cipal Guelph  and  Ghibelline  families,  showing  that  the
majority  of  the  older  houses  was  almost  invariably  Ghibel-
lines, whereas  the  Guelph  party  included  many  "  of  no  great
antiquity,"  but  "  already  beginning  to  be  powerful."
Later  on,  when  the  Ghibellines  are  destroyed,  we  shall
find  the  Guelph  nobles  merged  in  the  party  of  the  well-to-do
burghers  {popolo  grasso).  At  present  these  patricians,
being  hostile  to  the  Uberti,  begin  to  make  advances  to
newly  enriched  families,  and  even  to  the  people,  by  siding
with  the  Church.  Fortunately  Pope  Innocent  III.  started
a  Crusade  at  this  time,  and  thus  many  powerful  Florentines
went  to  the  East  and  employed  their  fighting  powers  in  a
better  cause.     At  the  siege  of  Damietta,  in  fact,  they  dis-

tingulshed  themselves  greatly  :  Bonaguisa  dei  Bonaguisi
the  first  to  scale  the  walls,    planted  the  banner   of  the
Republic  beside  the  Christian  flag.     In  Giovanni  Villani's
time   this  banner   was   still   preserved  and   held   in   the
greatest  honour.

In  121 8  Florence  resumed  hostilities  in  the  contado^
and  by  1220  had  subdued  various  castles  and  domains,
and  exacted  oaths  of  fealty  fi-om  all  defeated  foes.  But
immediately  afterwards  a  far  graver  war  broke  out  with
Pisa.  The  jealousy  of  the  two  rival  republics  was  always
on  the  increase,  and  for  some  time  past  each  had  struggled
against  the  other  for  absolute  commercial  supremacy  in
Tuscany.  Pisa  commanded  the  sea,  Florence  the  main-
land, therefore  each  city  required  the  other's  help.
Hence,  in  spite  of  repeated  agreements  and  treaties,
their  mutual  jealousy  remained  undiminished.  The  Floren-
tines adhered  steadfastly  to  the  Church  ;  the  Pisans  to
the  Empire.  Things  had  gradually  become  inflamed  to
so  high  a  pitch  that  the  smallest  trifle  was  enough  to
excite  war,  or  rather  to  provoke  the  endless  series  of
wars  destined  to  change  the  character  of  the  Tuscan
factions.

In  fact,  the  first  pretext  for  strife,  at  least  as  related
by  Villani  (vi.  2),  is  futile  to  the  point  of  utter
absurdity.  Many  ambassadors  attended  the  coronation
of  the  Emperor  Frederic  II.  in  Rome  (1220),  and  among
them,  says  the  chronicler,  were  those  of  Pisa  and  Florence,
who  had  long  eyed  one  another  with  distrust.  It  chanced
that  one  of  the  Florentine  ambassadors,  while  feasting
with  a  cardinal,  begged  the  gift  of  a  certain  very  beautiful
dog,  and  his  host  promised  to  grant  it.  The  next  day
the  cardinal  entertained  the  Pisans,  and  one  of  them,
happening  to  make  the  same  request,  the  animal  was
promised  likewise  to  him.  But  the  Florentine,  being  the
first  to  send  for  the  dog,  he  actually  obtained  it.     This


FLORENCE  AT  WAR  WITH  PISA.  177

led  to  quarrels  and  violence,  not  only  on  the  part  of  the
ambassadors  and  their  trains,  but  also  between  all  the
Pisans  and  Florentines  in  Rome  at  the  time.  We  can
hardly  assign  any  historical  value  to  this  tale  ;  but  it
shows  that  the  amount  of  ill-feeling  between  the  rival
states  rendered  any  trifle  a  sufficient  pretext  for  blood-
shed. The  real  fact,  even  according  to  the  testimony  of
Sanzanome,  is  that  Pisans  and  Florentines  came  to  blows
in  Rome.  The  Pisans  were  the  assailants,  but  had  the
worst  of  the  bout.  There  was  great  wrath  in  Pisa  at  the
news  of  the  riot,  and  as  a  speedy  reprisal  all  Florentine
merchandise  in  the  town  was  made  confiscate.  Florence
then  seems  to  have  done  her  utmost  to  avoid  open  war,
but  to  no  purpose.  Preparations  went  on  for  some  time
on  either  side,  and  then  in  1222,  when  war  had  burst
forth  between  the  Lucchese  and  Pisans,  the  Florentines
profited  by  the  opportunity  to  attack  the  latter  near  Castel
del  Bosco,  defeated  them,  and,  according  to  the  chroniclers,
carried  off  thirteen  hundred  prisoners.  Other  attacks
ensued,  and  various  small  castles  were  captured  between
this  time  and  1228,  when  we  see  the  Florentines  engaged
in  more  serious  strife  with  the  Pistoians,  and  reducing
them  to  accept  their  terms.  It  is  in  1228  that  we  find
the  first  mention  of  the  Carroccio  on  a  Florentine  battle-
field. ^  The  Milanese  had  been  the  first  to  use  the
Carroccio^  but  in  course  of  time,  and  with  slight  modifica-
tions, the  custom  had  been  adopted  by  the  other  Italian
cities,  who,  with  Increasing  wars  and  larger  forces,  recog-
nised the  need  of  a  rallying  point  in  their  midst.  The
Carroccio  was  a  chariot  drawn  bv  oxen  with  scarlet
trappings  and  surmounted  by  two  lofty  poles  bearing  the
great  banner  of  the  Republic,  swinging  its  red  and  white
folds  on  high.  Behind,  on  a  smaller  car,  came  the  bell,
called  the  Martimlla^  to  ring  out  military  orders.     For

some  time  before  a  war  was  proclaimed  the  Martinella
was  attached  to  the  door  of  Sta  Maria  in  the  New
Market,  and  rung  there  to  warn  both  citizens  and
enemies  to  make  ready  for  action.  The  Carroccio  was
always  surrounded  by  a  guard  of  picked  men  ;  its  sur-
render was  considered  as  the  final  defeat  and  humiliation

of  the  army.

Another  prolonged  and  sanguinary  conflict  with  Sieima
was  undertaken  and  resumed  almost  yearly  from  1227  to
1235.  The  Siennese  suffered  severe  losses,  but  were  able
to  seize  Montepulciano,  demolish  its  towers  and  ram-
parts, and  do  some  damage  to  Montalcino,  which  had
joined  alliance  with  the  Florentines.  The  latter,  however,
not  only  devastated  the  Siennese  contado  time  after  time,
and  captured  a  large  number  of  prisoners,  but  also  be-
sieged the  hostile  capital,  and  although  failing  to  win  it,
pressed  close  enough  to  the  walls  to  hurl  donkeys  over
them  with  catapults,  to  prove  their  contempt  for  the
town.  Finally,  through  the  mediation  of  the  Pope,  peace
was  concluded  very  advantageously  for  Florence.  The
Siennese  had  to  forfeit  a  large  sum  of  money  for  the  re-
building of  the  walls  and  towers  of  Montepulciano,  were
sworn  to  leave  that  territory  for  ever  unmolested,  and
likewise  compelled  to  repair  the  castle  of  Montalcino,  at
the  pleasure  of  the  Florentines,  who  still  retained  their
hold  on  Poggibonsi.

II.

Thus,  throughout  all  these  wars,  in  which  the  influence
of  Pope  and  emperor  was  felt  on  this  or  the  other  side,
we  are  enabled  to  trace  the  gradual  formation  of  parties
in  Tuscany,  and  to  witness  the  process  by  which  the
political  and  commercial  supremacy  of  Florence  was  built
up.     Her  present  rivals.  Sienna  and  Pisa,  both  adhere  to

the  Empire  ;  whereas  Florence  clings  more  and  more
closely  to  the  Church.  Pisa  shuts  her  out  from  the  sea  :
hence  the  origin  of  their  mutual  rivalry  and  continual
strife.  How,  indeed,  could  war  be  avoided,  when  the
commercial  power  of  Florence  felt  the  increasingly  im-
perative need  of  free  access  to  the  coast }  Sienna,  on  the
other  hand,  competed  with  Florence  by  trying  to  get  all
the  affairs  of  the  Roman  curia  into  the  hands  of  its  own
bankers,  those  affairs  being  so  numerous  and  lucrative  as
to  enrich  all  concerned  with  them.  These  continual
jealousies  invariably  urged  Pisa  and  Sienna  to  favour  the
Empire.  Lucca,  as  the  rival  of  Pisa,  inclined  towards
Florence,  and  became  Guelph.  Pistoia,  planted  between
two  Guelph  cities,  and  continually  menaced  by  them,
naturally  adopted  the  Ghibelline  cause.  Thus,  the
division  of  parties  in  Tuscany  afterwards  reacted  on  the
formation  of  Florentine  sects,  and  as  the  latter  began  to
assume  a  more  general  character,  through  the  growing
influence  of  Frederic  II.  in  Italy,  they  adopted  the
German  names  of  Guelphs  and  Ghibellines.  The  Floren-
tine Republic,  having  triumphed  over  Pisa,  Sienna,  and
Pistoia,  was  virtually  the  chief  power  in  Tuscany  ;  but
had  one  danger  to  face,  in  the  possible  augmentation  of
Frederic's  power.  Frederic  II.  was  the  enemy  of  the
Pope,  who  had  excommunicated  him,  and  of  all  Guelphs  !
He  had  gone  away  for  a  time  to  lead  the  Crusade  in  the
East ;  was  now  in  Germany  engaged  in  a  struggle  with
his  rebellious  son,  and  all  this  had  greatly  advanced  the
fortunes  of  Florence.  But  he  was  about  to  return  to
Italy,  and  his  presence  might  again  embolden  the  foes  of
the  Republic.

Meanwhile,  under  the  rule  of  successive  Podesta,
Florence  had  prospered  in  war,  and  devoted  times  of
peace  to  internal  organisation  and  embellishment.  At
the  instance  of  the  Podesta  Torello  da  Strada  (1233)  all

the  male  inhabitants  of  the  contado  were  summoned  to
inscribe  their  names  and  specify  their  condition,  whether
freemen,  serfs,  or  dependents,  with  a  view  to  ascertaining
the  real  state  of  the  population  and  providing  for  its
better  government.  In  1237-38  the  Podesta  Rubaconte
da  Mandello  built  a  new  bridge  over  the  Arno,  which
was  first  designated  by  his  own  name  of  Rubaconte,  and
afterwards  as  the  Ponte  alle  Grazie,  in  honour  of  an
adjoining  church.  It  was  also  by  order  of  the  same
Podesta  that  all  the  streets  of  Florence  were  first  paved,
and  other  works  completed  for  the  improvement  of  the
public  health,  or  the  decoration  of  the  city.  Thus  a
magistrate  originally  appointed — according  to  the  chroni-
clers— to  do  the  work  of  an  ordinary  judge  is  seen
gradually  fulfilling  the  functions  of  the  head  of  the
Republic,  And  the  patricians  over  whom  he  presided
daily  rose  to  greater  power  and  daring,  and  particularly
when  the  arrival  of  Frederic  II.  began  to  encourage  the
Ghibelline  party  throughout  Italy.  In  fact,  when  Breseia
was  besieged  by  the  Ghibellines  in  1237,  we  find  many
Florentine  nobles  in  their  camp.  Every  day  brought
fresh  proofs  that  the  emperor  might  count  on  many
friends  and  much  assistance  from  Florence.  Consequently
numerous  riots  took  place,  for  the  Guelph  nobles  offered
violent  opposition  and  joined  with  the  people,  which  was
entirely  Guelph.  ^  In  1240  we  find  that  three  citizens
were  nominated  to  collect  funds  in  aid  of  the  Imperial
army  :   surely  a  strange  proceeding  in   a  republic  ^  where

'  Villani  (vi.  33)  says  :  "  Albeit  the  said  parties  existed  among  the
nobles  of  Florence,  and  they  oftentimes  came  to  blows  from  private
enmities,  and  were  split  into  factions  by  the  said  parties,"  nevertheless
the  people  "  remained  united,  for  the  good  and  honour  and  dignity  of  the
Republic"  (vol.  i.  p.  253).  The  "  Annales,"  ii.,  of  the  year  1236  relate
that  the  palaces  of  the  Commune  and  of  the  Galigai  were  destroyed,
which  would  certainly  seem  to  be  a  proof  of  a  genuine  revolution.

GUELPHS  AND  GHIBELLINES.  i8i

the  mass  of  the  population  was  thoroughly  Guelph  !  But
it  is  not  surprising  that  such  events  should  have  inevitably
caused  a  reaction.

Already  in  1246  Frederic  II.  had  appointed  his  natural
son,  Frederic  of  Antioch,  vicar-general  of  Tuscany,  and
also  sent  other  vicars  to  Florence  to  fill  the  office  of
Podesta.  This  aroused  discontent  on  the  part  of  the
Guelph  nobles,  who  wished  their  own  faction  to  regain
the  upper  hand  in  the  city.  About  this  time,  1247,
Frederic  was  in  Lombardy,'  and  at  almost  open  war  with
the  Pope,  who  continued  to  launch  excommunications  at
him,  deprived  him  of  the  Imperial  title,  and  stirred
enemies  from  all  sides  against  him.  Accordingly,
Frederic  sent  messengers  to  the  Uberti  in  Florence,
advising  them  that  the  moment  had  come  for  them  to
assume  the  government  of  Florence.  Provided  they  had
the  courage  to  fly  to  arms,  his  succour  would  not  be  long
delayed.  The  Uberti  were  not  deaf  to  his  words.  The
heads  of  the  chief  Ghibelline  houses  met  in  council  and
decided  on  immediate  resort  to  violence.  There  was
instant  division  in  the  city  ;  the  Ghibelline  aristocracy
on  one  side,  the  Guelph  nobles,  with  all  the  people  on  the
other ;  and  the  alarm  bell  was  pealed.  Fighting  went  on
from  street  to  street,  by  day  and  by  night,  behind  barri-
cades, from  tower-roofs,  and  with  catapults,  rams,  and
other  engines  of  war.  As  the  popular  excitement
increased  the  strife  became  general.  The  Ghibellines
had  the  advantage  of  superior  military  training  ;  they
were  confident  of  receiving  reinforcements  ;  and,  massed

Frederic  II.  complains  of  their  conduct,  saying:  "Pars  Guelforum
Florentiae,  cui  dudum  nostra  Maiestas  pepercerat."  The  "  Annales,"  ii,,

Ghibellines.  Vide  Hartwig,  "  Quellen,"  &c.,  vol.  ii.  pp.  159-60  and

under  one  leader,  took  all  their  orders  from  the  Uberti
palaces.  The  people,  on  the  contrary,  fought  at  random,
and  were  soon  surrounded  and  repulsed.  Nevertheless,
at  one  moment  their  very  defeat  seemed  about  to  win
them  the  victory.  Hard-pressed  on  all  sides,  they  were
gradually  driven  back  towards  the  chain  barricades
(serraglio)  of  the  Bagnesi  and  Guidalotti  mansions ;  and
being  massed  about  this  defence,  fought  so  vigorously  as
almost  to  regain  their  former  position.  But  just  then  the
Imperial  contingent  appeared  on  the  scene,  and  all  was
lost.  The  vicar-general  Frederic,  son  of  the  emperor,
entered  Florence  at  the  head  of  sixteen  hundred  German
knights,  and  made  furious  charges  on  the  people.  The
latter  opposed  a  sturdy  resistance,  prolonging  the  fight  for
three  days,  but  it  was  a  vain  struggle.  The  Ghibellines
were  victorious  on  all  sides,  and  the  emperor  could  have
sent  fresh  reinforcements  if  required.  One  of  the  most
valiant  of  the  Guelphs,  Rustico  Marignolli,  who  had  borne
the  standard  of  the  people  throughout  the  melee,  fell
wounded  to  the  death  by  a  shot  in  the  face  from  a  cross-
bow. Thereupon  the  leaders  of  the  party  finally  decided
to  surrender  and  fly  into  exile  on  Candlemas  night
(February  2,  1249).  All  those  resolved  on  flight  gathered
together  fully  armed,  and  taking  possession  of  Marig-
nolli's  corpse,  bore  it  away  in  a  solemn  procession  with
a  crowd  of  popolaniy  and  a  great  show  of  weapons  and
torches,  to  celebrate  the  funeral  at  San  Lorenzo  by  night.
The  bier  was  carried  on  the  shoulders  of  the  worthiest
cavaliers,  and  the  defeated  but  not  dishonoured  banner
hung  trailing  from  it  to  the  ground.  The  whole  function
resembled  a  pact  of  vengeance  sworn  on  the  body  of  the
dead  warrior  rather  than  a  mere  burial  ceremony.

After  this  the  leading  Guelphs  fled  the  city  and  took
refuge  in  neighbouring  castles  ;  the  same  in  fact  from  which,
at  the  cost  of  much  blood,  they  had  once  ousted  the  feudal

lords.  These  latter,  having  been  compelled  to  settle  in  the
town,  had  now  won  their  revenge  for  past  injuries.  Thirty-
six  Guelph  houses  were  pulled  down  :  among  them  the
Tosinghi  palace  in  the  New  Market,  a  building  measuring
one  hundred  and  thirty-five  feet  in  height,  and  faced  with
many  tiers  of  marble  columns.  Party  hatred  reached
such  a  pitch  as  to  justify  the  belief  expressed  by  many
that  the  Ghibellines  had  positively  decreed  the  destruc-
tion of  San  Giovanni,  because  the  Guelphs  had  used  that
church  as  a  place  of  assembly.  It  was  affirmed  that  the
victors  had  undermined  the  foundations  of  the  adjoining
Guardamorto  tower,  hoping  that  this  might  fall  down  on
the  temple  and  crush  it.  The  failure  of  the  attempt  was
attributed  to  the  fact  that  the  tower  had  miraculously
fallen  in  another  direction.  A  more  credible  account  is
given  by  Vasari.  He  says  that  the  Guardamorto  was  only
demolished  in  order  to  widen  the  Piazza,  and  that  Niccolo
Pisano,  being  charged  with  the  work,  cut  the  tower  in  two
and  arranged  its  fall  in  a  way  to  avoid  any  damage  to  the
church  or  neighbouring  houses.

At  all  events,  this  proved  the  beginning  of  the  long
list  of  savage  reprisals  darkening  the  history  of  Florence,
when  the  winning  faction  not  only  destroyed  the  dwellings
of  the  defeated,  but  banished  their  foes  en  masse.  The
Ghibellines  were  now  masters  of  all,  and  for  their  greater
security  retained  the  services  of  Count  Giordano  Lancia
and  his  eight  hundred  Germans.  It  seemed  as  though
the  party,  being  of  Teutonic  origin,  could  not  yet  grasp
the  reins  of  government  without  the  support  of  German
soldiery,  and  could  only  command  the  Republic  in  the
emperor's  name.  This  was  the  final  result  of  admitting
the  Imperial  feudal  nobiUty  within  the  walls  of  Florence,
and  allowing  them  to  institute  a  political  and  military
chief  instead  of  an  ordinary  judge  in  the  person  of  the
Podesta.

III.

The  Ghibelline  victory  over  the  Guelphs  of  Florence  in
1249,  with  all  its  violence  and  bloodshed,  was  by  no  means
an  assured  triumph.  The  Ghibellines  had  destroyed  free
institutions  and  exiled  a  vast  number  of  adversaries  ;
aided  by  the  Imperial  vicar,  Giordano  Lancia  and  his
eight  hundred  men,  they  were  absolute  masters  of
Florence  ;  nevertheless,  the  populace,  the  burghers,  and
the  greater  part  of  the  citizens  still  remained  Guelphs.
Besides,  Pope  Innocent  IV.  roused  so  many  enemies
ao-ainst  the  emperor  in  Italy,  that  the  latter's  success  was
destined  to  a  speedy  decline.  The  Florentine  exiles  were
biding  their  time  in  neighbouring  strongholds,  and  above
all  in  the  Castles  of  Montevarchi  and  Capraia  in  the  upper
and  lower  Val  d'Arno.  From  these  points  they  made
frequent  skirmishing  expeditions,  clearly  showing  that  \
they  had  by  no  means  lost  hope  of  soon  re-entering  the
city.  Accordingly,  the  conquerors  had  to  be  perpetually
on  the  alert  against  them  to  provide  against  some  sudden
attack  restoring  them  to  power.

Therefore  Ghibellines  and  Germans  marched  against
Montevarchi ;  but  almost  the  whole  storming  force  was
killed  or  captured.  This  defeat  opened  the  eyes  of  the
Florentine  Ghibellines  to  the  danger  of  their  position,  and
decided  them  to  lay  regular  siege  to  the  Castle  of  Capraia,
headquarters  of  the  principal  Guelphs,  chiefs  of  the  party
or  League,  as  it  was  called  at  the  time,  directing  all  the
movements  of  the  rest.  Although  the  beleaguering  force
greatly  outnumbered  their  own,  the  besieged  decided  on
an  obstinate  defence,  and  the  Ghibellines  were  bent  on
winning  the  castle  either  by  violence  or  starvation.  But
they  would  have  failed  to  accomplish  this  but  for  the
arrival  of  reinforcements  from  the  emperor,  who,  having


EMPEROR  AND  POPE.  185

been  compelled  to  raise  the  siege  of  Parma,  had  now
advanced  into  Tuscany.  But,  in  spite  of  these  fresh  foes,
hunger  alone  drove  the  Guelphs  to  surrender.  Their
leaders  were  given  up  to  Frederic  II.,  who  was  then  at
Fucecchio.  He  carried  them  with  him  to  the  kingdom
of  Naples,  and,  according  to  the  Florentine  chroniclers,
had  them  barbarously  blinded,  beaten  to  death  with  clubs,
or  drowned  in  the  sea,  with  the  exception  of  one  alone,
whose  life  was  spared  after  his  eyes  had  been  torn  out.

By  this  time  the  emperor  was  irritated  and  exhausted
by  the  continual  wars  thrust  on  him  by  the  Papacy.  He
had  enjoyed  no  peace  since  the  day  (June  24,  1243)  when
Sinibaldo  de  Fieschi  ascended  the  Chair  of  St.  Peter  as
Pope  Innocent  IV.  This  pontiff  had  pronounced  his
deposition  at  the  Council  of  Lyons  in  1245.  -^^  ^^^
then  secretly  excited  many  conspiracies  against  him,  and
attempted  more  or  less  to  ensure  their  success.  The
emperor  had  been  led  to  suspect  his  most  devoted  friend
and  secretary,  Pier  delle  Vigne,  of  complicity  in  one  of
these  plots.  Accordingly  this  faithful  servant  was  thrown
into  the  tower  of  San  Miniato  al  Tedesco,  condemned  to
lose  his  eyes,  and  then  transferred  to  another  prison  in
Pisa,  where  he  dashed  out  his  brains  against  the  wall.
Frederic's  spirit  was  alternately  cowed  and  irritated  by
the  hostility  he  encountered ;  for,  with  all  his  philosophy
and  unbelief,  he  greatly  dreaded  the  thunders  of  the
Vatican.  He  sought  reconciliation  with  the  Pope,  wished
to  return  to  the  East  to  fight  the  infidels  ;  and  Innocent
chose  that  moment  to  rouse  all  the  Guelph  cities  against
him,  thus  again  forcing  him  to  fly  to  arms  to  support  the
Ghibelline  cause  and  maintain  his  own  sway  over  Italy.

This  he  was  unable  to  effect  without  recurrino;,  as
we  have  seen,  to  incredible  excesses  ot  violence,  which
naturally  increased  the  number  of  his  enemies  on  all
sides.     The  Guelphs  of  Germany  had  already  refused  to

acknowledge  the  authority  of  his  son  Corrado,  whom
he  had  sent  as  his  representative.  The  army  commanded
by  the  emperor  in  person  had  been  routed  at  Parma.  All
the  Guelph  cities  of  Romagna,  with  Bologna  at  their  head,
marched  a  powerful  force  against  the  Ghibellines  under
King  Enzo,  another  of  Frederic's  natural  sons,  and
defeated    them    at    the    battle    of  Fossalta  on    May    26,

1249.  Enzo  himself  was  captured  and  carried  in
triumph  to  Bologna,  where  he  remained  a  prisoner  till
his  death  in  1271.  But  the  emperor  did  not  live  long
enough    to    feel    this    last    blow.       On    December    13,

1250,  he  ceased  to  breathe  in  a  castle  near  Lucera  in
Apulia,  and  his  death  completed  the  downfall  of  the
Ghibelline  party  in  Florence  and  throughout  Italy.
For  religious  hatred  was  now  combined  with  political
enmity  against  this  party.  Not  only  because  the
Ghibellines  combated  the  Pope,  but  still  more,  because
the  various  heresies  gradually  spreading  through  Italy
found  many  followers  in  their  ranks,  in  consequence
of  frequent  marks  of  tolerance  and  favour  received  from
the  emperor.  The  heretical  poison  now  slowly  infecting
the  Italian  social  body  was  a  grave  anxiety  to  the  Popes,
The  Albigenses  had  first  roused  attention  and  found
adherents  in  Provence,  where  native  bards  had  devoted
their  talents  to  attacking  the  Roman  Court.  But  the
religious  orders  of  St.  Francis  and  St.  Dominic  were
bent  on  crushing  the  new  creed.  Innocent  III.  had
founded  the  Holy  Inquisition  for  the  same  purpose,
and  St.  Dominic,  at  the  head  of  mobs  thirsting  for
heretic  blood,  had  ordained  the  massacre  of  the  Albi-
genses and  ravaged  all  Provence.  Some  fugitives,  how-
ever, had  escaped  into  Italy,  to  spread  the  same  hatred
against  Rome,  the  same  poison  of  heresy.  In  fact,  the
Pateriniy  opposed  to  the  Pope,  denying  the  virginity  or
the  Madonna,  and  having  no  belief  in  transubstantiation


PAPAL  PERSECUTION  OF  HERESY.  187

or  other  dogmas  of  the  Catholic  faith,  found  followers
everywhere  and  held  public  gatherings.  The  Epicurean,
Averrhoistic,  and  other  philosophical  tenets  were  rapidly-
propagated  among  Italian  scholars.  For  some  time,
during  the  most  brilliant  period  of  the  Imperial  Court
in  Sicily,  all  this  intellectual  and  religious  turmoil  seemed
to  be  chiefly  centred  at  Palermo.  For  there  Frederic  11.
had  gathered  about  him  a  throng  of  scholars,  troubadours,
poets  of  every  kind,  Musselmans,  Greek  schismatics,
Provencal  Albigenses,  and  materialistic  philosophers ;  and
although  a  crusader  and  persecutor  of  heretics,  took
singular  delight  in  this  mixed  society,  in  whose  midst,
and  in  a  storm  of  sarcasm,  doubt,  and  hatred  of  priests,
Italian  poetry  first  sprang  to  life,  and  later  on,  in  the
Divine  Comedy,  gave  forth  so  great  a  wealth  of  earnest
faith  and  lofty  aspiration.  In  the  meantime,  however,
heresy  and  scepticism  were  current  throughout  the
Peninsula.  The  Paterini  quickly  obtained  many  con-
verts among  the  Ghibellines  in  Florence,  and  the  Pope
established  the  Inquisition  there  for  the  trial  and  punish-
ment of  backsliders.  In  1244  Fra  Pietro  of  Verona,
moved  by  religious  fury  rather  than  zeal,  came  to  stir
the  orthodox  spirit  by  his  inflammatory  sermons  ;  and
founded  the  Society  of  the  Captains  of  Holy  Mary  or
of  Faith,  composed  of  men  and  women  vowed  to  the
extermination  of  heretics.  Public  feeling  caught  fire  in
1245,  and  a  real  battle  between  Catholics  and  heretics
raged  in  the  Florence  streets.  Both  at  Santa  Felicita
and  in  the  space  by  the  Croce  al  Trebbio,  where  a
column  still  commemorates  the  ill-fated  event,  the  Cap-
tains of  the  Faith,  robed  in  white,  bearing  the  badge
of  the  cross,  and  commanded  by  their  big,  strong,  dare-
devil chief,  Friar  Pietro  of  Verona,  routed  the  Paterini
and  drove  them  from  Florence.  In  reward  for  this
sanguinary  triumph  the  friar  was  appointed  Inquisitor  of


1 88  STATE  OF  PARTIES.

Tuscany,  and  subsequently  of  Lombardy  as  well.  There
in  the  north,  between  Milan  and  Como,  he  finally  met
his  death  at  the  hands  of  men  wearied  of  his  persecutions.
This  gained  him  the  title  of  a  martyred  saint,  and  he  was
known  henceforth  as  St.  Peter — Martyr  of  Verona,  i


IV.

Meanwhile,  in  1250,  the  year  now  claiming  our  atten-
tion, Frederic  II.  passed  away,  his  son  Enzo  lay  captive
in  Bologna,  Innocent  IV.  was  stirring  the  Guelphs  to
action,  and  Pietro  of  Verona  had  become  the  scourge
of  all  heretics  and  foes  of  the  Papacy  in  Tuscany  and
Lombardy.  Accordingly  the  Ghibelline  domination  in
Florence  was  approaching  its  end.  In  fact,  from  the
moment  that  the  emperor  withdrew  into  Apulia,  already
stricken  with  mortal  disease,  the  Guelphs  showed  so  much
boldness  that  the  Ghibellines  decided  on  a  fresh  expe-
dition to  oust  them  from  the  Castle  of  Ostina,  in  the
Valdarno,  where  they  had  assembled  in  great  force.  But
while  laying  siege  to  the  stronghold  the  Ghibellines  were
compelled  to  keep  a  strong  reserve  at  Figline  to  protect
their  rear  from  the  many  Guelph  partisans  lurking  at
Montevarchi.  The  latter,  however,  made  a  night  attack  on
the  force  encamped  at  Figline,  and  routed  it  so  thoroughly
that  when  the  news  reached  Ostina  the  Ghibellines  raised
the  siege  and  marched  back  to  the  capital.  Thereupon
both  the  people  and  burghers  of  Florence,  tired  of  the
unbearable  load  of  taxation  imposed  on  them  by  the
continual  wars  undertaken  by  the  Ghibellines,  and  worn
out  by  the  "  grave  extortions  and  acts  of  violence  of  these
tyrannical  masters,"  felt  that  the  moment  for  vengeance  had

THE  FLORENTINE  GUELPHS  IN  REVOLT      189

come,  and  rose  in  open  revolt.  The  rebels  were  led  by
the  more  influential  citizens  of  the  so-called  middle  class,
then  acting  as  heads  of  the  people.  These  men  first  held
their  sittings  in  the  Church  of  San  Firenze,  then  in  Santa
Croce,  and  finally,  still  dreading  attack  from  the  Uberti,
assembled  in  smaller  numbers  and  with  greater  safety  in
the  houses  of  the  Anchioni  family.  Here,  in  October,
1250,  they  proclaimed  the  nomination  of  thirty-six
*'  Corporals  of  the  people,"  six  to  each  sestiere,  forming
the  basis  of  the  third  Florentine  Constitution,  known  as
the  First  Popular  Government  [Primo  Popolo)^  because
its  main  purpose  was  to  organise  and  strengthen  the  people
in  opposition  to  the  nobles,  and  by  this  time  the  latter
being  much  disheartened,  unresistingly  submitted  to  the
new  government.  The  first  measure  adopted  was  the
dismissal  of  all  the  magistrates  in  office,  and  reforms  were
then  undertaken.  The  post  of  Podesta  was  retained,
and  henceforth  this  official  became  still  more  exclusively
the  head  of  the  patricians,  being  now  counterbalanced  by
the  newly  instituted  Captain  of  the  people,  as  chief  of
the  popolani.  But,  as  in  this  way  the  Republic  was
divided  in  two  parts,  a  central,  presiding  body  was  estab-
lished consisting  of  twelve  elders  (anziani)  of  the  people,
two  for  each  sestiere.  These  anziani  had  some  of  the
attributes  of  the  Consuls  of  former  days,  with  this
difference,  however,  that  not  only  were  they  men  of  the
people,  but  that  the  chief  government  of  the  city  was
now  entrusted  to  the  Podesta  and  the  Captain.  In  fact,
the  new  and  most  important  part  of  the  reform  was  this
institution  of  a  Captain  as  commander  of  the  people,  who
were  now  organised  on  a  military  footing.  The  city
was  divided  into  twenty  armed  companies,  with  twenty
gonfalons  or  banners,  under  as  many  gonfalonieri.  The
contadoy  on  the  contrary,  was  organised  in  ninety-six
companies,    corresponding   with    its    ninety-six    existing


rgo  STATE  OF  PARTIES.

parishes  (pivieri).  These  town  and  country  companies
combined  formed  a  united  popular  militia,  ready  for
action  at  any  moment,  either  against  foreign  foes  or  to
curb  patrician  tyranny  at  home.  The  whole  of  this  armed
multitude  was  under  the  orders  of  the  Captain,  and  as
he  combined  the  functions  of  tribune,  general,  and  judge,
he  afterwards  bore  the  additional  titles  of  Defender  of  the
Guilds  and  the  People^  Captain  of  all  the  Guelphs^  &c.
Similarly  to  the  Podesta,  the  Captain  held  office  for  one
year,  and  it  was  indispensable  that  he  should  be  a  Guelph,
a  noble,  and  an  alien.  He  came  to  Florence  provided
with  his  own  judges,  knights,  and  war-horses,  inasmuch  as
he  was  leader  of  the  people  in  war  and  administrator  of
justice  in  times  of  peace.  But,  as  we  have  already  stated,
the  Podesta  still  retained  his  civil  and  military  importance.
In  right  of  his  office,  he  had  to  give  judgment  in  all  civil
and  criminal  cases,  those  reserved  for  the  Captain's  decision
being  usually  acts  of  violence  committed  by  the  grandi
against  the  people,  questions  regarding  taxes  or  valuations,
and  certain  cases  of  extortion,  perjury,  and  violence,  pro-
vided these  had  not  been  already  cited  before  the  Podesta,
or  unless  he  should  have  refused  them  his  attention.  ^
Also,  in  the  above-mentioned  cases,  the  Captain  was  like-
wise empowered  to  adjudge  capital  punishment.  The  red
and  white  gonfalon  or  banner  of  the  people  was  in  his
charge,  and  by  ringing  the  bell  of  the  so-called  Lion's
Tower  he  summoned  the  people  to  assembly.  He  resided
in  the  Badia,  together  with  the  elders,  who  acted  as  his
counsellors  in  many  respects.  Messer  Uberto  of  Lucca
was  the  first  Captain  of  the  people.  As  to  the  Podesta,

statements  of  Villani  and  Malespini,  believed  his  office  to
have  been  at  least  temporarily  abolished,  it  is  certain  that
he  remained  at  the  head  of  what  was  specially  called  the
Commune. I  He,  too,  had  his  companies  of  armed  men,
and  likewise  commanded  the  mounted  bands  composed
almost  exclusively  of  nobles,  the  bowmen  and  cross-
bowmen,  bucklermen  (^-palvesart)^  &c.,  forming  con-
jointly the  so-called  host,  or  nucleus  of  regulars  in  the
mass  of  the  Republican  army.  The  Podesta  was  often
commander-in-chief  of  the  whole  army,  but  his  special
function  was  the  command  of  the  cavalry  and  the  host
ipste),'^  And  for  the  further  enhancement  of  his  dignity,
it  was  decided  to  build  a  great  and  monumental  palace, 3
in  which  he  was  to  hold  residence  with  his  attendant
officers  and  counsellors.  But,  on  the  other  hand,  as
nothing  was  neglected  to  increase  the  strength  of  the
people  against  the  patricians,  it  was  decreed  that  the
towers  of  all  powerful  houses  should  be  cut  down  so  that
none  should  exceed  the  height  of  seventy-five  feet  (fifty
brace  id)  y  and  the  superfluous  material  was  used  to  wall  in
the  city  on  the  south  side  of  the  river  (o/Zr'  Arnd)A

This  third  constitution  of  Florence,  known  as  the
Primo  PopolOy  or  First  Popular  Government,  was  in  fact  a
politico-military  constitution,  dividing  the  Republic  into
two  halves,  the  Commune  and  the  people,  and  in  which
the  aristocrats  and  democrats  formed,  as  it  were,  two
opposing  camps.     The  army  was   marshalled  under  the

Florence,  and  dismissed  all  the  officers"  (vi.  39).  As  usual,  Malespini
copies  from  Villani  (chap,  cxxxvii.).  But  reading  farther  we  see  clearly
that  the  Podestk  was  elected  as  before,  and  that  a  palace  was  built  for
his  use.  The  chronicler's  real  meaning  was  that  the  form  of  government
was  changed,  and  the  actual  governors  dismissed  from  office.  The  term
Podestk  was  used  in  its  general  sense  of  magistrate-in-chief.

banners  both  of  the  Commune  and  the  people  ;  all  im-
portant measures  required  the  sanction  both  of  the  Com-
mune and  the  people.  A  similar  division  of  authority
may  seem  strange  at  this  day,  but  it  was  common  enough
in  the  Middle  Ages.  It  was  customary  to  many  Tuscan
cities,  and  we  find  an  example  of  it  at  Bologna,  where
the  nobility  and  people  formed,  as  it  were,  two  distinct
republics,  having  different  laws  and  statutes,  and  two
separate  palaces  for  their  respective  magistrates.  At
Milan  we  find  a  tripartite  republic  in  the  Credenza  dei
Consoli,  the  Motta,  and  the  Credenza  di  Sant  Ambrogio,
consisting  respectively  of  the  greater  and  middle  nobility
and  the  people.  This  seemed  a  perfectly  natural  arrange-
ment, seeing  that  social  conditions  are  reflected  in  the
institutions  to  which  they  give  birth ;  the  social  body  was
divided,  because  it  owed  its  origin  to  the  struggle  between
the  Latin  and  Teutonic  races,  between  conquerors  and
conquered.  Accordingly,  the  remote  heirs  of  either  race
stood  arrayed  in  two  opposite  camps,  armed  and  prepared
for  conflict.^

In  this  state  of  things  it  is  easy  to  understand  why  the
central  government  had  so  little  authority  in  Florence,
and  why,  during  the  continual  clash  of  opposing  interests
and  jealousies,  the  power  of  the  Podesta  and  the  Captain

says  :  "Almost  all  the  families  on  the  Ghibelline,  or  Imperial  side,  were
nobles  of  the  contado,  because  these  held  lands  or  castles  in  fief  from
the  Empire."  Also  Ammirato,  who  was  well  versed  in  contemporary
chronicles  and  documents,  in  relating  what  was  said  by  men  of  the
people  as  to  the  reforms  of  1250,  makes  them  continue  their  statement
that  the  Uberti,  as  leaders  of  the  nobles,  were  the  authors  of  all  the  mis-
fortunes of  Florence,  with  the  following  words  :  "  Who  but  the  Uberti
waste  our  substance  and  our  strength  by  exorbitant  taxes  and  imposts?
These  haughty  men  deemed  it  an  honourable  thing,  among  their  other
grand  and  noble  usages,  to  be  our  foes  ;  inasmuch  as,  exulting  in  their
descent  from  the  princes  of  Germany,  they  consider  us  to  be  churls  and
peasants,  and  despise  us,  as  though  we  were  of  a  different  clay  from  their
own."    Ammirato,  "  Storie,"  bk.  ii,  ad  annum.

should  have  steadily  increased.  The  former,  although  his
functions  were  now  shared  by  other  magistrates,  still
remained  the  chief  official  representative  of  the  Republic  ;
for  he  signed  treaties  of  peace,  accepted  concessions  of
territory  in  that  capacity,  received  oaths  of  submission  to
Florence  from  other  towns,  and,  as  in  times  past,  still  con-
tinued to  preside  over  two  councils — i.e.^  the  Special  and
the  General,  respectively  composed  of  ninety  and  of  three
hundred  members.  The  Captain  had  likewise  two  coun-
cils, the  which,  according  to  the  usage  of  the  time,  con-
sisted of  a  Special  Council,  or  credenza,  of  eighty  members,
making,  in  junction  with  the  Council-General,  a  total  of
three  hundred.  This  body  included  the  elders,  the  heads
of  guilds,  the  gonfaloniers  of  companies,  and  others,  and,
unlike  the  councils  of  the  Podesta,  to  which  nobles  were
admitted,  solely  consisted  of  plebeians.  Members  of  the
Special  Council  frequently  sat  in  the  General  Assembly,
which  was  therefore  usually  styled  the  General  and  Special
Council  of  the  Podesta,  or  the  Captain,  as  the  case  might
be.  The  elders  had  a  privy  council  of  their  own,  com-
posed of  thirty- six  plebeian  worthies  ;  and  the  parliament
must  not  be  forgotten,  although  at  the  time  of  which  we
are  treating  it  was  only  summoned  on  occasions  of  excep-
tional importance.  But,  as  will  be  shown,  some  time
elapsed  before  these  councils  were  established  on  a  definite
basis  ;  none  for  the  moment,  save  those  of  the  Podesta,
which  were  of  older  origin,  having  any  settled  formation.  1
At  any  rate,  the  Republic,  as  regarded  its  general  outline,
was  ordered  in  the  following  manner  :  the  elders,  the
council  of  thirty -six,  and  the  parliament,  formed  a  central
government,  already  much   weakened,   however,  by   the

Santa  Trinita  bridge  was  built,  chiefly  at  the  expense  of  a
private  citizen.  The  gold  florin  was  now  issued,  and,
being  mixed  with  the  best  alloy,  speedily  obtained
currency  '  not  only  in  all  European  markets,  but  even  in
the  Levant,  greatly  to  the  advantage  of  Florentine  com-
merce, which  was  daily  becoming  more  widely  extended.
The  nobles  were  discontented,  of  course,  and  hastened  to
show  their  ill-feeling,  in  125 1,  by  their  almost  unanimous
refusal  to  join  in  the  war  against  Pistoia.  But  when  a
few  of  them  were  sent  into  banishment  the  others  soon
quieted  down.  The  Guelph  exiles  were  recalled,  adversaries
within  the  city  made  peace,  and  now,  that  Frederic  II.
was  dead,  the  aristocracy  was  kept  in  check  by  the
strength  and  self-confidence  of  the  popular  party.  Shortly
afterwards  external  wars  began,  and  these  were  carried  on
with  so  much  success  that  the  following  ten  years  were
known  as  the  years  of  victory.

because  it  was  in  fact  the  first  time  that  the  people  had  a
political  and  military  organisation  of  their  own,  quickly
asserted  its  strength.  In  order  to  give  the  spreading
Florentine  trade  free  access  to  the  sea,  without  yet  coming
to  blows  with  Pisa,  the  city  concluded  an  agreement  on
April  30,  1 25 1,  with  the  Counts  Aldobrandeschi,  power-
ful lords  of  the  Maremma,  by  which  Florence  was  granted
right  of  passage  through  their  territories  to  Porto  Talamone
and  Port'  Ercole  and  the  free  use  of  these  harbours  for  its
merchandise. 2  Thereupon  the  Pisans,  being  naturally
annoyed  by  this  measure,  hastened  to  contract  an  alliance

FRESH  STRIFE   WITH  THE  GHIBELLINES.     197

with  Sienna,  to  which  Pistoia  also  adhered.  Thus  the
three  Ghibelline  cities  were  banded  together  against  the
Florentine  Guelphs.  Nor  was  this  the  worst.  On  July  24,
1 25 1,  the  Ghibellines  of  Florence  joined  the  League  by  a
secret  agreement  with  Sienna,  binding  either  side  to  co-
operate towards  their  common  aim — i.e.,  the  triumph  of
their  party  throughout  Tuscany.  And  as  the  other
Ghibellines  of  the  country-side  naturally  adhered  to  the
treaty,  the  whole  faction  was  united  to  the  hurt  of  the
Republic.

Then  the  Florentines,  finding  themselves  surrounded
by  so  many  foes,  began  their  defence  by  a  rapid  march
on  Pistoia,  but  the  Ghibellines  of  the  city  refused  to  take
part  in  a  war  openly  directed  against  their  cause.  Accord-
ingly, when  the  army  returned  from  a  successful  skirmish-
ing expedition,  many  leading  Ghibellines,  including  the
Uberti  and  the  Lamberti,  were  driven  into  banishment.
The  affair  must  have  been  really  serious,  for  the  exiles
hoisted  the  banner  of  the  Republic,  whereupon  the  State
banner  was  changed,  and  instead  of  bearing  the  white  lily
on  a  red  field,  henceforth  displayed  the  red  lily  on  a  white
field  ;  but  the  flag  of  the  people  remained  as  before,  half
white  and  half  red.  During  the  summer  of  this  year  the
Ubaldini,  reinforced  by  a  body  of  exiles,  rose  to  arms  in
the  Mugello,  but  suffered  defeat.  The  Florentines  at  last
realised  the  danger  of  their  position.  Therefore,  with  the
help  of  their  former  friends  the  Lucchese,  they  concluded
an  alliance  (August,  125  i)  with  the  town  of  San  Miniato
al  Tedesco — where  there  was  no  Imperial  vicar  for  the
moment — renewed  in  September  their  former  treaty  with
Orvieto,  and  in  November  made  alliance  with  Genoa,
which  was  still  hostile  to  Pisa.

Thus  the  whole  of  Tuscany  was  divided  between  the
Guelph  and  Ghibelline  factions.  The  exiles,  together,  with
some  German  soldiers  who  had  served  under  Frederic  II.,

occupied  the  Castle  of  Montaia,  belonging  to  Count  Guido
Novello,  in  the  upper  Val  d'Arno.  The  Florentines
marched  to  the  assault  of  the  stronghold  towards  the  end
of  the  year,  but  were  ignominiously  repulsed.  On  their
return  to  the  city,  they  rang  the  alarm-bell,  collected  a
large  force,  again  took  the  field,  people  and  Commune
combined,  and  pursued  the  war  with  energy  during  the
month  of  January,  regardless  of  frost  and  snow.  The
general  condition  of  affairs  in  Tuscany  enlarged  the  pro-
portions of  this  war ;  for  on  the  one  side  Lucchese  troops
co-operated  with  the  Florentine  army,  while  the  exiles  on
the  other  received  reinforcements  from  Pisa  and  Sienna.
The  First  Popular  Government  now  proved  its  mettle.
The  adversaries  were  driven  off",  the  Castle  of  Mentaia  cap-
tured and  demolished,  and  its  defenders  were  led  captives
to  Florence  in  January,  1252.^

The  Florentines  then  marched  into  the  Pistoian  terri-
tory, laid  it  waste,  and  halted  to  attack  the  Castle  of
Tizzano  on  their  return.  But  while  thus  engaged  they
heard  that  the  Pisans,  having  routed  the  Lucchese,  were
moving  homewards  with  prisoners  and  spoil.  Accordingly,
they  raised  the  siege,  hastened  in  pursuit,  and  giving
battle  to  the  Pisans  at  Pontedera  on  July  i,  1252,  com-
pletely defeated  them.  Even  the  Podesta  of  Pisa  was
captured,  and  another  curious  incident  took  place.  The
Lucchese  prisoners  who  were  being  dragged  to  Pisa  in
bonds  not  only  regained  their  liberty,  but  were  enabled,  by
the  help  of  the  Florentines,  to  convey  to  Lucca  as  captives
the  same  Pisans  by  whom  they  had  been  previously  seized.

Meanwhile,  profiting  by  the  absence  of  the  Florentine
troops,  the  exiles  and  Count  Guido  Novello  had  taken
refuge  at  Figline  and  made  it  the  centre  of  continual
skirmishing  expeditions.  Hence  it  was  indispensable  to
unearth  them  all  without  delay.     The  town  surrendered,

but  only  on  condition  that  the  strangers  defending  its  wall
should  be  allowed  to  go  free,  and  the  exiles  readmitted.
This  was  granted  but  then,  in  violation  of  the  stipulated
terms,  Figline  itself  was  sacked  and  burnt  (August,
1852).!

But,  the  Siennese  having  simultaneously  profited  by  the
opportunity  to  lay  siege  to  Montalcino,  a  border  fortress
always  claimed  by  the  Florentines,  the  latter  hastened  to
its  relief,  and  after  routing  its  assailants  and  providing
everything  for  the  future  defence  of  the  stronghold,
marched  back  to  Florence  in  triumph.

These  successes  were  not  unproductive  of  results.  For
when  the  Florentines  next  attacked  Pistoia  in  1253,  the
town  surrendered  after  a  brief  resistance,  and  agreed
I  (February  i,  1254)  to  forsake  the  Ghibelline  League,  to
grant  readmittance  to  the  Guelphs,  and  to  be  entirely  at
the  service  of  Florence.^  Thereupon  the  Florentines
hastened  to  defend  Montalcino  against  another  attack  by
the  Siennese  ;  and  thus  the  war  with  the  latter,  begun  at  the
end  of  1253,  was  vigorously  pursued  in  1254,  to  the
month  of  June.  Then,  having  lost  many  strongholds —
some  captured  by  Florentine  arms,  others  gained  by  pur-
chase from  the  Counts  Guidi — Sienna  was  forced  to  end
the  war  and  tender  submission.  On  their  way  back  to
Florence  the  victors  reduced  Poggibonsi,  a  large  and  im-
portant territory  adhering  to  Sienna  and  the  Ghibellines.
They  next  proceeded  to  devastate  the  lands  about  Volterra,
although  the  city  itself  seemed  impregnable  from  the
strength  of  its  position.  But  when  the  Volterrani,  count-
ing upon  this,  ventured  to  sally  forth  and  give  battle,  they
were  defeated  and  pursued  with  so  much  vigour,  that  the
Florentines  found  themselves  inside  the  city  before  they
had  even  conceived  the  possibility  of  storming  its  walls.

There  was  such  general  alarm  among  the  inhabitants  that  a
great  throng  of  old  men,  women,  and  children,  with  the
bishop  at  their  head,  came  as  suppliants  to  make  surrender.
The  Florentines  showed  much  generosity,  prohibiting
pillage,  and  merely  reform.ing  the  government  of  the  city
by  transferring  it  to  the  Guelphs.  And  now  Pisa,  being
bereft  of  all  allies,  finally  agreed  to  surrender,  and  the
terms  were  subscribed  on  August  4,  1254.  As  a  result  of
this  treaty  the  Florentines  had  right  of  passage  through
Pisa,with  their  merchandise,  and  exemption  from  all  taxes,
dues,  or  imposts,  whether  by  sea  or  by  land.  Moreover,
in  all  contracts  made  with  them,  the  Pisans  were  bound  to
employ  Florentine  weights  and  measures,  and  also,  to
some  extent,  Florentine  money.  They  yielded  several
districts  and  castles,  that  of  Ripafratta  included.  And
they  were  compelled  to  give  150  hostages  to  secure
their  observance  of  these  conditions  and  of  the  friendship
to  which  they  were  sworn.  Shortly  after  this  event
Arezzo  likewise  made  submission  (25th  of  August),  and
accepted  a  Podesta  from  Florence.^

These  were  the  "  victorious  years  "  of  the  First  Popular
Government,  whose  merits  and  virtues  received  such
high  praise  from  the  chroniclers.  Villani  tells  us,  in  words
afterwards  repeated  by  his  plagiarist,  Malespini,  that  it
took  "  much  pride  in  great  and  lofty  undertakings,"  and
that  its  rulers  "  were  very  loyal  and  devoted  to  the
Commune,"  2  And  he  presently  adds  :  "  The  citizens  of
Florence  lived  soberly,  on  coarse  viands  and  at  little
expense  ;  their  manners  were  very  good  ;  they  had  courteous
ways  ;  they  were  plain  and  fi-ugal ;  and  used  rough  stuff  for
their  own  and  their  women's  dress.  And  manv  wore
skins  uncovered  by  cloth,  and  caps  on  their  heads  ;  all  were
shod  with  leather ;  and  the  Florentine  women  wore  plain
hose,  and  only  the  greater  among  them  donned  very  narrow

at  the  waist  by  a  leather  belt  in  the  old  style,'  and  a  fur-
lined  mantle  with  a  hood  attached  to  cover  the  head  ;  2  and
common  women  wore  gowns  of  coarse  green  Cambragio
stuff,  made  in  the  same  fashion.  And  one  hundred  lire
was  the  usual  dowry  for  a  bride,  two  or  three  hundred  lire
being  considered  in  those  times  a  splendid  sum,  and  even
the  most  beautiful  maidens  were  not  given  in  marriage
until  they  were  aged  twenty  years,  or  more."  3  Even  the
evidence  of  the  '*  Divina  Commedia  "  fully  corroborates
this  account  of  the  goodness  and  honesty  of  the  Florentines
of  old,  and  events  continued  to  prove  the  truth  of  the
verdict.

Fortune  favoured  the  city  not  only  in  war,  but  also  in
peace  both  within  and  without  the  walls.  In  addition  to
the  many  great  public  works  we  have  already  mentioned,
and  which  were  now  completed,  other  buildings  were  in
course  of  erection  on  various  sites  bought  by  the  anziani
for  the  purpose  in  different  parts  of  the  city.  These
officials,  together  with  the  captain  of  the  people,  Lamber-
tino  di  Guido  Lambertini,  likewise  decreed  (1252-53)
that  the  register  of  all  the  communal  deeds  should  be
re-copied  and  carried  on  regularly,  in  order,  as  they  said,
that  the  jura  et  rationes  Cotnmunis  might  not  be  left
unknown  nor  neglected,  but  open  to  the  public  in  various
places.  These  papers  are  the  capitoli  still  preserved  at
the  present  time,  and  affording  so  much  useful  informa-
tion on  the  history  of  Florence.4

Now,  however,  the  state  of  affairs  was  about  to  take  a
fresh  turn.    In  consequence  of  Conrad's  decease,  Manfred,

the  other  son  of  Frederic  II.,  succeeded  to  the  Neapolitan
throne.  The  new  sovereign,  being  dauntless,  ambitious,
and  full  of  talent,  devoted  all  his  powers  to  forwarding  the
interests  of  the  Italian  Ghibellines  ;  and  the  Florentines,
with  their  usual  shrewdness,  immediately  became  more
cautious  in  their  proceedings.  In  1255  they  made  alliance
with  Sienna,  the  following  year  with  Arezzo,  severely
blamed  their  captain,  Count  Guido  Guerra,  for  expelling
the  Ghibellines  from  the  latter  city,  and  compelled  him  to
recall  them.  They  even  treated  their  own  exiles  with
greater  indulgence  and  liberality,  permitting  some  of  them
to  return  from  time  to  time.  But  on  either  side  these
were  false  demonstrations,  leading  to  no  result.  All  were
temporising,  waiting  to  see  what  fresh  turn  the  general
affairs    of  Italy  might  take.

Supposing  Manfred's  fortunes  to  be  really  restored,  the
Florentines  would  suffer  severely,  and  of  this  they  were
perfectly  aware.  A  first  warning  was  received  by  them  in
1256,  when  the  Pisans,  oblivious  of  sworn  terms  and
promises,  made  an  attack  upon  Ponte  a  Serchio,  a  castle
held  by  the  Lucchese,  the  allies  of  Florence.  Accordingly
the  Florentines  hastened  to  their  friends'  relief,  and  routed
the  assailants,  many  of  whom  were  drowned  in  the  river
in  their  flight.  After  this  victory  the  troops  marched
towards  Pisa  and  coined  money  in  sight  of  the  walls,  an
act  then  considered  to  inflict  deep  humiliation  on  the
enemy.  In  addition  to  this  the  Pisans  were  not  only
forced  to  renew  (September  23,  1256)  the  ignominious
peace  concluded  in  i  254,  but  also  to  cede  many  castles  to
the  Florentines,  and  some  few  to  the  Lucchese.^  And
another  clause  was  added  to  the  terms  stipulating  that  the
Castle  of  Mutrone,  a  position  of  great  strategical  impor-
tance both  to  Lucchese  and  Florentines,  should  be  given
up  to  the  latter,  with  power  to  destroy  or  preserve  it,  as

FLORENTINE  PATRIOTISM,  203

their  magistrates  might  decide.  Accordingly  the  ques-
tion was  discussed  by  a  council  of  elders  in  Florence,  and
one  of  the  number,  Aldobrandino  Ottobuoni,  who,  although
poor  and  plebeian,  had  much  influence  as  a  patriot,  asserted
the  necessity  of  demolishing  the  fortress.  His  proposal
was  carried,  but  with  the  proviso  that  it  should  be  first
submitted  to  the  approval  of  the  parliament.  Meanwhile
the  Pisans,  unaware  of  the  result  of  the  discussion  and  of
Ottobuoni's  amendment,  but  knowing  that  the  castle,  it
held  by  the  Lucchese,  would  be  a  serious  menace  to  them-
selves, sent  to  offer  Ottobuoni  four  thousand  florins — in
those  days  a  prodigious  sum — if  he  would  address  the
council  in  favour  of  the  very  plan  he  had  already  pleaded
with  success.  But  this  offer  merely  opened  his  eyes  to  the
blunder  he  had  committed,  and  returning  to  the  council,
he  induced  the  elders  to  reverse  their  decision.  Aldi-
brandino's  reputation  was  so  greatly  enhanced  by  this  affair,
that  on  his  death  it  was  decreed  that  a  monument  should
be  erected  to  him  in  the  Duomo  of  greater  height  than
any  other,  and  at  the  public  expense.*

Many  men  were  famed  for  their  virtue  in  the  time  of
the  First  Popular  Government  ;  but  this  government  only
lasted  ten  years,  and  a  period  of  new  reforms  and  revolu-
tions, costing  much  travail  to  the  Republic,  is  already  near
at  hand.

'  Villani,  vi.  62.  This  incident,  highly  praised  by  Villani  as  a  magnani-
mous example,  has  been  quoted  by  others  as  a  proof  that  the  Floren-
tine people  must  have  been  corrupt  at  a  time  when  so  exceptional  a
monument  could  be  decreed  to  one  of  the  citizens  simply  because  he  had
refused  to  betray  his  country.  But  it  should  be  noted,  first  of  all,  that
he  was  not  honoured  with  a  monument  merely  because  he  had  rejected  a
bribe,  but,  as  Villani  goes  on  to  say,  because  "  Aldobrandino  died  in  such
excellent  repute  for  his  virtuous  deeds  for  the  good  of  the  Commune."
Even  should  Villani's  praises  of  the  deed  in  itself  seem  too  marked  and
consequently  indicative  of  general  corruption,  this  corruption  might  be
more  fitly  attributed  to  Villani's  o\vn  days  than  to  the  earlier  period  of
Aldobrandino  and  the  Primo  Popolo,  when  genuine  virtue  and  true
patriotism  were  undoubtedly  predominant.


204  STATE  OF  PARTIES,

The  seeds  of  revolt  were  already  lurking  in  the  Consti-
tution, and,  as  we  have  seen,  only  waiting  a  convenient
opportunity  to  break  forth.  Nor  was  the  moment  long
delayed.  The  Ghibelline  party,  after  declining  in  conse-
quence of  Frederic's  decease,  was  now  revived  in  Italy  by
the  strenuous  efforts  of  Manfred  in  its  cause.  This
monarch's  envoys  finally  came  to  Florence  in  1258,  and
naturally  made  their  abode  with  the  Uberti,  whom  they
found  quite  prepared  to  try  the  hazard  of  war.  These
nobles  quickly  assembled  their  adherents,  and  formed  a
plot  for  the  overthrow  of  the  popular  government.  But
the  times  were  not  yet  ripe,  because,  as  Machiavelli  has
justly  remarked,  "  In  those  days  the  Guelphs  had  much
more  power  than  the  Ghibellines,  partly  because  the  people
hated  the  latter  for  their  arrogant  conduct  as  rulers  in
Frederic's  time  ;  and  partly  because  the  side  of  the  Church
was  in  greater  favour  than  that  of  the  emperor,  seeing
that  with  the  aid  of  the  Church  they  [the  Florentines]
"  hoped  to  preserve  their  liberty,  and  feared  to  lose  it  under
the  emperor."  '-  The  conspiracy  was  soon  discovered,  in
fact,  and  the  Uberti  were  cited  to  appear  before  the  elders.
But,  instead  of  obeying  the  summons,  they  barricaded
themselves  within  their  own  dwellings  by  the  advice  of
their  chief,  Farinata.  Thereupon  the  enraged  people  flew
to  the  assault ;  the  houses  of  the  Uberti  were  sacked  ;
some  of  their  friends  captured,  others  killed,  and  no  m^ercy
shown  even  to  those  merely  suspected  of  complicity.  The
Abbot  of  Vallombrosa,  one  of  the  Beccaria  of  Pavia,  was
beheaded,  although  his  innocence  was  afterwards  acknow-
ledged by  many.-  The  whole  Uberti  family  and  their
principal  followers  had  to  seek  safety  in  exile  and  fly  to

FLORENCE  DECLARES  WAR.  205

Sienna,  the  which  city  was  the  declared  ally  of  Manfred,
and  the  headquarters  of  all  Tuscan  Ghibellines,  The
exiles  collected  there  chose  Farinata,  the  most  daring  and
influential  member  of  the  band,  for  their  leader.  Upon
this  the  Florentines  justly  complained  that  the  Siennese
violated  the  treaty  of  1255  by  harbouring  the  fugitives  ;
but  Sienna,  having  been  long  the  secret  ally  of  the  Ghibel-
lines, was  deaf  to  remonstrance.

Hence  collision  was  inevitable,  and  Florence  dealt  the
first  blow  by  speedily  attacking  several  castles  and  villages
in  the  Siennese  Maremma.i  Then  the  Martinella  was
hung  in  the  arch  of  the  Mercato  Nuovo,  and  repeatedly
rang  the  alarm,  announcing  an  expedition  of  far  greater
importance.  Both  sides  began  to  prepare  for  war,  and
even  summoned  their  friends  to  assemble.  Florence  had
sent  Brunetto  Latini  on  an  embassy  to  Alfonso  of  Castile,
one  of  the  aspirants  to  the  Imperial  crown,  inviting  him
to  march  into  Italy  against  Manfred.  The  Siennese,  how-
ever, had  already,  and  with  greater  hopes  of  success,
applied  for  help,  through  the  Florentine  exiles,  to  Manfred
in  person.  This  monarch  being  much  occupied  with  his
own  kingdom  at  the  time,  despatched  Giordano  d'Anglona,
Count  of  San  Severino,  with  about  one  hundred  German
knights,  who  reached  Sienna  in  December,  1259,  bearing
the  royal  banner.  At  last,  in  April,  1260,  the  Florentines
set  forth  with  the  carroccio^  people  and  Commune  in  full
array,  with  the  Podestd  lacopino  Rangoni,  the  elders  and
leaders  of  companies  at  their  head,  and  encamped  close  to  the
walls  of  Sienna,  near  Porta  CamoUia.  On  the  17th  of  May
a  battle  took  place  on  the  site  of  the  monastery  of  Santa

Petronilla.     It  is  related  that  when  Farinata  degli  Uberti,
who,  as  chief  of  the  exiles,  had  done  much  to  promote  the
war,  saw  how  small  a  contingent  Manfred  had  sent  with
the  standard,  he  exclaimed  :  '•  We  will  lead  it  into  such
straits,  that  he  [the  king]  will  fain  be  the  enemy  of  the
Florentines,   and  will  give   us    more    [knights]  than   we
shall    want."  ^     It  is  also  told  that  the  German  soldiers
were  purposely  intoxicated  to  make  them  fight  with  blind
fury.2       What    is    certain   is  that    the    Siennese    citizens
marched  out  under  the  command  of  their  Podesta,  and
that  the  Germans,  jointly  with  the  exiles,  of  whom  Farinata
was  still  the  chief,  were  led  by  Count  Guido   Novello.
The  Germans  began  the  engagement  with  so  furious  an
onslaught   that   the    Florentines,  believing    a   formidable
army  was  on  them,  scattered  in  dismay  ;  but  then,  per-
ceiving the  hostile  force  to  be  inferior  to  their  own,  stood
their   ground    valiantly,    and    after    a   sanguinary    melee
repulsed  the  foe,  and  capturing  Manfred's  flag,  dragged
it  in  the  mud.     There  was  much  rejoicing  in  Florence,
although  the  victory  had  been  dearly  bought,  and  it  was
seen  that  a  small   band   of  well- trained  German  cavalry
had  put  to  the  rout,  at  least  for  a  moment,  a  large  army
of  peasants  and  artisans.     The  Siennese  derived  courage
from    the    same    fact,   particularly   now  that  their    chief
citizen,  Provenzano  Salvani,  and  other  ambassadors,  were
returning  from  Naples  with  a  stout  contingent  of  eight
hundred  3  Germans,  also  under  the   command   of  Count
Giordano,  now  promoted  to    the   post  of  vicar-royal  to
Manfred  in  Tuscany.

Accordingly  the  war  had  to  be  pursued  ;  for  with  the

bonsi,  and  devastate  Colle,  Montalcino,  and  Monte-
pulciano,  the  Florentines  were  compelled  to  resume
hostilities.  Farinata  degli  Uberti  and  his  fellow-exiles
continually  cast  fresh  fuel  on  the  flame  by  using  every
device  of  ingenuity  to  provoke  their  foes,  and  weave
treasonable  plots  within  the  walls  of  Florence.  In  fact,
two  friars  were  sent  there  to  inform  the  elders,  with  great
affectation  of  secresy,  that  Sienna  was  weary  of  the  Ghibel-
lines  and  of  Provenzano  Salvani's  domination,  that
accordingly  it  would  be  easy  to  have  the  gates  opened
to  the  Florentine  army  by  means  of  a  bribe  of  ten
thousand  florins.  The  friars,  being  deceived  them-
selves, as  it  appears,  had  no  difliculty  in  duping  others.
According  to  Villani's  account,  on  arriving  in  the  city,
they  asked  leave  to  confer  with  two  elders  alone,  under
pledge  of  the  strictest  secresy.  Two  members  were
deputed  to  receive  their  proposals,  who,  believing  the  men
to  come  from  the  exiles,  sons  of  their  own  Republic,  and
forgetting  how  they  had  always  been  dominated  by  party
hatred,  accepted  the  false  message  in  good  faith.  Althoup"h
great  mystery  was  observed  in  the  afl^air,  yet  it  was  neces-
sary to  consult  the  citizens  before  deciding  on  war.  For
that  purpose  a  numerous  council  of  nobles  and  popolani
was  assembled,  and  the  elders,  under  more  or  less  plausible
pretexts,  urged  the  necessity  of  quickly  resuming  the  war
against  Sienna.  Nevertheless,  there  was  much  disagreement.
Although  the  Florentine  laws  opposed  every  possible
check  to  general  discussion,  and  especially  when  directed
against  any  proposal  brought  forward  by  a  magistrate,^

'  Here  is  an  instance  extracted  from  a  law  of  1284  :  "  Item  quod  nullus
presumat  consulere,  vel  arengare  super  aliquo  quod  non  sit  principaliter
propositum  per  dominum  Potestatem,  vel  aliquem  loco  sui.  Et  qui
contrafacerit,  in  soldos  sexaginta  florenorum  parvorum  vice  qualibet
puniatur,  et  plus  et  minus  ad  voluntatem  domini  Potestatis.  Et  quic-
quid  dictum  vel  consultum  contra  propositionem,  non  valeat,  nee  teneat.'

2o8  STATE  OF  PARTIES.

the  import  of  this  question  was  seen  to  be  so  grave,  that
several  speakers  combated  it,  pointing  out  the  enormous
folly  of  plunging  into  war  at  this  moment,  when  it  was
known  that  Sienna  had  no  means  of  maintaining  the
Germans  for  long.  The  nobles  were  specially  adverse
to  the  proposal,  for  they  had  recognised  the  superiority
of  the  German  cavalry,  and  judged  that  no  army  com-
posed of  artisans  and  traders,  little  practised  in  war,  could
possibly  make  a  stand  against  it,  especially  now  that  it
was  in  much  greater  force.  Also,  seeing  what  progress
had  been  already  made  in  the  art  of  war,  battles  could  no
more  be  won  by  deeds  of  personal  prowess  alone.  Un-
luckily the  opposition  of  the  nobles  inflamed  the  people
in  the  contrary  sense,  and  set  them  shouting  that  they
must  arm  and  march  forth  without  delay.  Tegghiaio
Aldobrandi  degli  Adimari  was  one  of  the  first  patricians
to  speak  against  the  proposal  and  in  favour  of  delay.
But  an  elder  named  Spedito,  and,  according  to  Villani,  one
of  the  two  sharing  the  secret,  replied  to  him  in  insulting
terms,  winding  up  with  a  coarse  sneer  at  Adimari's  sup-
posed cowardice.  1  Whereupon  Messer  Tegghiaio  retorted,
exclaiming  that  Spedito  would  lack  the  courage  to  follo"\v
far  at  his  heels  in  battle.  After  this  squabble  Cece
Gherardini  rose  up  and  openly  inveighed  against  the  war
proposed  by  the  elders.  The  latter  then  insisted  on  his
silence,  in  the  name  of  the  law,  threatening  to  make  him
pay  the  fine  of  one  hundred  lire  imposed  by  the  statutes
on  all  venturing  to  speak  without  the  permission  of  the
magistrates  ;  but  Gherardini  replied  that  he  would  pay  it
and  speak.  Accordingly  they  increased  the  fine  to  two
hundred,  then  to  three  hundred  /z><?,  but  only  succeeded  in
silencing  him  by  threats  of  capital  punishment. ^  So  the
motion  for  war  was  finally  carried,  although  even  with-

out  the  secret  intrigues  retailed  and  exaggerated  by  the
chroniclers,  the  heated  state  of  public  feeling  made  hos-
tilities unavoidable.

The  Florentine  army  was  still  commanded  in  1260  by
the  same  Podesta  who  had  led  it  to  battle  the  previous
May.  But  it  was  now  reinforced  by  all  the  Guelphs  of
Tuscany,  from  Perugia,  Orvieto,  Bologna,  and  many
other  cities,  so  that  its  total  strength  amounted  to  thirty
thousand  foot  and  three  thousand  horse.  This  large  force
marched  forth  in  the  month  of  August,  with  all  its  chiefs,
with  the  Carroccioy  and  a  well-furnished  baggage  train,
crossed  the  Siennese  border,  and  reaching  Pieve  Asciata
on  September  2nd,  halted  there  to  rest.  The  intrigues
carried  on  by  the  exiles  had  produced  two  results  ;  for
on  the  one  hand  they  had  inspired  Florence  with  the
vain  hope  that  Sienna  could  be  gained  without  bloodshed,
merely  by  spending  money  and  making  a  great  show  of
strength  ;  on  the  other  hand  there  were  traitors  in  the
army  itself,  actually  pledged  to  secret  agreements  with
the  enemy.  The  first  measure  adopted  was  to  send
messengers  to  the  city  haughtily  demanding  its  surrender.
But  when  these  envoys  entered  Sienna  they  found  the  whole
population  burning  for  war  and  revenge.  They  were
solemnly  received  by  the  Council  of  Twenty-four,  the
heads  of  the  State  ;  and  these,  on  hearing  their  demands,
made  reply  :  "  That  they  should  have  an  answer^  by  word
of  mouthy  in  the  fields  Hence  the  only  thing  to  do  was
to  prepare  for  a  decisive  engagement.

On  the  morning  of  the  3rd  of  September  a  herald
went  through  the  streets  of  Sienna  calling  on  all  men  to
hasten  to  join  his  own  flag,  "  in  the  name  of  God  and  the
Virgin  Mary."  i  Thus  a  considerable  army  was  collected
and  marched  the  same  day  to  encounter  the  Florentines.

2IO  STATE  OF  PARTIES.

The  details  supplied  by  the  chroniclers  are  so  discrepant
that  it  is  difficult  to  decide  as  to  the  exact  strength  of  the
force.  The  Germans,  the  exiled  Ghibellines  of  Florence,
and  several  contingents  from  allies  swelled  the  Siennese
ranks.  Nevertheless  the  total  number  was  certainly
inferior  to  that  of  the  enemy.  According  to  custon\,
the  Podesta,  Francesco  Troghisio,  held  the  post  of  Com-
mander-in-chief. But  the  actual  leaders  of  the  armv
were  Count  Giordano  and  Count  D'Arras  in  command  of
the  German  horse  and  foot ;  Count  Aldobrandino  of  Santa
Flora,  and  other  valiant  captains.  The  Florentine  exiles,
including  Farinata  degli  Uberti,  who  was  excited  to  the
highest  pitch,  M'ere  under  the  command  of  Count  Guido
Novello.  The  army  of  Florence  was  also  led  by  its
Podesta,  Jacopo  Rangoni  ;  but  its  captains  were  untrained
men,  who  still  clung  to  the  hope  of  winning  the  victory
without  striking  a  blow.  They  advanced  with  the
Carroccio  as  far  as  Monselvoli  in  Val  di  Biena,  and
encamped  at  a  short  distance  from  the  Arbia  stream  and
the  fortress  of  Montaperti,  some  four  miles  from  Sienna.
On  the  morning  of  the  4th  of  September  the  Siennese,
and  more  especially  the  Germans,  began  the  battle  by  a
tremendous  onslaught.  The  Count  of  Arras  kept  his
men  in  ambush  in  order  to  fall  on  the  enemy's  flank
at  the  best  moment.  Until  the  hour  of  vespers,  the
Florentines  made  a  steadfast  resistance,  but  then  began  to
show  signs  of  failing  strength.  Thereupon  Arras  led  up
his  reserve  with  cries  of  "  St.  George,"  and  attacked  them
so  furiously  in  flank  that  they  were  speedily  routed.  At
the  same  moment  Bocca  degli  Abati,  one  of  the  Floren-
tine traitors,  severed  at  a  blow  the  hand  of  Jacopo  dei
Pazzi,  the  standard-bearer  of  the  cavalry.  As  the  flag
fell  the  troop,  composed  almost  entirely  of  nobles,
instantly  took  to  flight,  some  from  panic,  others  with
treasonable  intent.     But  the  infantry,  consisting  of  stout

popolani  and  faithful  allies,  stood  its  ground  for  a  time  ;
then  wavered,  gave  way,  and  was  involved  in  the  general
rout.  Only  the  guards  of  the  Carroccio^  commanded  by
Giovanni  Tornaquinci,  a  veteran  of  seventy  years,  who
fought  like  a  lion,  maintained  their  position  until  the  last
man  fell  dead  defending  the  banner.  Then,  finally,  the
Carroccioy  the  Martinella^  and  the  flag  of  the  Republic
were  captured  by  the  foe,  who  bore  their  spoil  to  Sienna
in  triumph  and  reduced  it  to  atoms.  ^  Great  slaughter
took  place,  and  although  many  Florentines  sought  safety
in  the  castle  of  Montaperti,  crying,  "  Mercy,  I  surrender!"
no  mercy  was  shown  them.  Finally  the  Siennese  captain,
Count  Giordano,  by  the  advice  of  Farinata  degli  Uberti
and  with  the  consent  of  the  gonfaloniers  of  the  people,
gave  orders  that  the  slaughter  should  be  stopped,  and
safety  granted  to  all  who  surrendered.^  It  is  difficult  to
decide  how  many  were  killed  on  that  fatal  day.  Villani,
keeping  to  the  minimum,  states  that  all  the  cavalry  escaped
by  flight,  the  slaughter  being  confined  to  the  infantry,
of  whom  2,500  were  killed  and  1,500  captured.  The
Siennese,  reducing  their  own  losses  to  600  killed  and  400
wounded,  estimate  those  of  the  Florentines  at  10,000
killed,  15,000  taken  prisoner,  5,000  wounded,  and  18,000
horses  either  killed  or  strayed.  These  figures  may  be
exaggerated,  but  Villani's  are  certainly  below  the  real
number.  3  Nevertheless,  the  chronicler  shows  the  true
state  of  things  when  he  says  in  conclusion,  "  and  then
the  ancient  Florentine  people  was  put  to  rout  and  annihi-
lated." 4      This,    in  fact,   was  the  ultimate  result  of  the

Carroccio  instead.

Sienna  triumphed  with  great  rejoicing,  great  festivi-
ties ;  but  there  was  a  terrible  outcry  and  lamentation  in
Florence,  where  no  family  had  escaped  loss.  The  leading
Guelphs  knew  that  their  last  chance  of  safety  had  vanished,
and  therefore  many  of  their  noble  families  fled  into  exile
together  with  a  considerable  number  of  popolani.  They
escaped  from  the  city  on  the  13th  of  September,  and
although  a  few  of  them  were  scattered  among  the  Tuscan
castles,  the  majority  repaired  to  Lucca,  this  being  still  the
chief  centre  of  the  Guelph  faction.

On  the  1 6th  of  September  Count  Giordano  entered
Florence  with  his  German  troops,  accompanied  by  the
Ghibelline  exiles  laden  with  spoil  and  ready  to  play  the
conquerors.  One  of  their  first  deeds  was  the  destruction
of  the  Ottobuoni  monument  in  the  Duomo,  forgetful  that
whether  Guelph  or  Ghibelline  that  virtuous  citizen  deserved
honour  as  a  patriot.  Thus,  from  the  beginning,  the
Ghibellines  did  their  best  to  make  themselves  more  de-
tested and  unbearable.  Poggibonsi,  Montalcino,  and
many  of  the  castles  which  had  cost  so  much  strife,  were
given  up  to  Sienna.  The  "  ordinances  of  liberty  "  were
annulled,  and  Count  Giordano  nominated  Count  Guido
Novello  Podesta  of  Florence  for  two  years.^  The  latter
immediately  took  possession  of  the  Communal  palace,  and
opened  a  road  thence  to  the  city  walls,  with  the  name  it
still  bears  of  Via  Ghibellina.  Meanwhile  sentences  of
banishment  and  persecution  of  all  sorts  befel  the  Guelphs.
Their  houses  and  towers  were  demolished,  and  their
confiscated  property  devoted  to  the  service  of  the  Ghibel-
line   cause,  which   was  everywhere  destined  to  triumph.

Brunette  Latini  was  also  condemned  to  exile.  As  we
have  seen,  he  had  been  an  ambassador  to  Alphonso  of
Castile,  and  was  now  in  France,  where  he  wrote  the
'*  Tesoro,"  containing  an  account  of  his  mission.

Count  Giordano,  being  recalled  to  Naples  by  Manfred,
soon  took  his  departure,  leaving  Guido  Novello  to  replace
him.  Thereupon  all  the  Ghibelline  chiefs  met  in  council
at  Empoli  to  arrange  what  was  to  be  done.  As  an  instance
of  the  pitch  of  ferocity  to  which  party  hatred  against
Florence  had  attained,  it  was  proposed  at  this  meeting  to
demolish  the  city  walls,  pull  down  all  the  houses,  and
reduce  this  "  nest  of  Guelphs "  to  a  mere  suburb,  since
otherwise  they  would  be  sure  to  revive  there  once  more.
But  Farinata  degli  Uberti  had  the  generosity  to  oppose
the  suggestion,  and  in  the  impulse  of  his  wrath  clapped
his  hand  on  his  sword-hilt,  and  declared  to  Count  Giordano
and  the  other  captains  that  he  had  fought  to  regain  his
country,  not  to  lose  it,  and  would  defend  it  against  all
would-be  destroyers  even  more  zealously  than  he  had
fought  against  the  Guelphs. ^  These  words  caused  the
wild  proposal  to  be  instantly  rejected.

Count  Guido  appointed  several  Ghibelline  Podesta  in
Tuscany,  while  retaining  the  general  government  of  that
province  in  his  own  grasp,  and  likewise  ruling  Florence  as
vicar  to  King  Manfred.  He  basely  allowed  himself  to
be  the  tool  of  Ghibelline  vengeance,  although  his  uncer-
tainty of  conduct  and  weakness  of  character  did  little
service  to  the  party.  Nevertheless,  the  Guelphs  continued
to  suffer  persecution,  not  only  in  Florence,  where  confisca-
tion of  their  property  and  destruction  of  their  dwellings


'  All  this  is  narrated  by  Villani  and  other  chroniclers,  and  is  likewise
recorded  by  Dante  in  the  "Divina  Commedia."  A  few  writers  have
tried  to  throw  doubt  on  the  incident,  but,  as  Dr.  Hartwig  justly  observes,
it  is  difficult  to  suppose  that  Guelph  chroniclers  would  have  invented  a
legend  so  entirely  favourable  to  the  Ghibelline  chief.

and  towers  were  long  the  order  of  the  day,i  but  also  in
the  neighbouring  castles  and  at  Lucca,  whence  all  fugitive
Guelphs  were  expelled.  It  was  on  this  occasion  that  Fari-
nata  degli  Uberti,  having  seized  Cece  dei  Buondelmonti,
hoisted  him  on  his  saddle  and  carried  him  off,  either  to
save  his  life,  as  some  have  said,  or,  according  to  another
version,  as  prisoner  of  war.  But  his  brother  Pietro  degli
Uberti  was  so  maddened  at  the  sight,  that  he  clubbed  the
captive  to  death  on  Farinata's  horse.  Such  was  the  ferocity
of  party  hatred  at  the  time.  After  the  defeat  of  1260
many  Guelphs  wandered  homeless  about  the  world.  Some
devoted  their  swords  to  the  service  of  their  faction  in
Emilia,  and  became  experts  in  the  newest  developments
of  militarv  science  ;  while  others  settled  in  France  as
traders,  thus  giving  a  fresh  and  much  increased  impulse
to  Florentine  commerce.


VII

From  the  close  of  1260,  the  year  of  the  battle  of
Montaperti,  down  to  j  266,  when  the  rule  of  Count  Guido
and  King  Manfred  came  to  an  end,  the  history  of  Florence
records  no  remarkable  event.  The  city's  freedom  is
crushed,  its  wars  reduced  to  petty  and  inglorious  party
strife,  and  its  new  institutions,  if  worthy  to  be  so  called,
have  no  effect  on  the  historical  development  of  the  Floren-
tine constitution.  In  trying  to  discover  the  logical  con-
nection between  the  various  forms  assumed  by  it  in  the
history  of  the  Republic,  no  attention  need  be  given  to  the
checks  suffered  by  freedom  nor  to  the  intervals  wherein
tyranny  breaks  the  regular  course  of  events  and  institu-

tions,  seeing  that  these  resume  their  normal  march  as  soon
as  liberty  is  restored  to  life.

The  Podesta  ruling  in  Manfred's  name  retained  the
two  councils,  /'.<?.,  the  general  council  of  three  hundred,
and  the  special  of  ninety  members,  in  both  of  which
the  nobles  and  the  Ghibellines  naturally  prevailed.  But
we  hear  nothing  more  of  the  Captain  of  the  people  and
his  councils,  nor  of  the  elders  and  their  assembly.  But  we
iind  in  their  place  a  body  of  twenty-four  citizens,  four  to
each  sesiiere,  privileged  to  sit  in  council  with  the  Podesta.^
Of  the  ancient  Constitution  a  few  fragments  alone  re-
main, and  even  these  are  ancient  only  in  name.  As
a  matter  of  fact  the  Ghibellines  had  succeeded,  with
Manfred's  assistance,  in  establishing  an  aristocratic
despotism,  as  strangely  different  from  the  constitution
preceding  it  as  from  that  destined  to  replace  it,  these
being  in  perfect  harmony  and  connection  one  with  the
other.

Meanwhile  the  war  against  the  Guelphs  was  carried  on,
not  only  by  razing  their  houses  and  confiscating  their
goods,  but  by  the  imposition  of  repeated  fines  weighing
heavily  on  the  lower  classes  who  were  now  deprived  of
all  share  in  the  government.  But  in  1264  Farinata  degli
Uberti  died,  in  1265  Dante  Allghieri  was  born,  and  Italy
I  began  to  be  stirred  by  novel  events  soon  to  be  echoed
even  in   Florence.

For  some  time  past,  in  truth,  Italian  politics  had  showed
signs  of  approaching  to  a  radical  change.  Frederic  II.,
although  often  cruelly  despotic,  had  gathered  about  him,
nevertheless,  all  the  most  cultured  men  of  the  country
and  was  highly  popular  among  them.  His  successor,
Manfred,  was  an  adventurous  and  unfortunate  prince,
whose  loftiness  of  spirit  deservedly  gained  him  numerous
admirers.     It  is  true  that  the  Papacy  had  combated  both

'  P.  Ildefonso,  "  Delizie,"  &c.,  vol.  ix.  p.  19  and  fol.


2i6  STATE  OF  PARTIES.

in  their  quality  of  Ghibellines  ;  but  the  policy  of  Rome
was  gradually  becoming  no  less  hostile  to  communal
freedom  than  to  the  Ghibelline  cause,  inasmuch  as  the
Papal  ambition  daily  increased  and  sought  to  strengthen
the  temporal  power  at  the  expense  of  the  communes.
Florence  still  remained  Guelph  ;  but  with  changed  times
the  character  and  value,  if  not  the  names  of  parties  were
beginning  to  suffer  alteration  throughout  Italy.  Hence
men  often  changed  sides  with  small  hesitation,  nor  was
it  always  easy  to  say  whether  those  who  deserted  their
own  party  had  changed,  or  whether  the  alteration  of  the
party  itself  had  caused  it  to  be  forsaken.  Also  the
general  confusion  was  greatly  increased  now  that  the
Popes,  with  their  usual  anxiety  and  dread  of  losing  their
supremacy  in  Italy,  resolved  on  calling  fresh  strangers
to  their   aid  and   thus  drew  fresh  miseries  on  the  land.

Alarmed  by  the  great  power  and  reputation  gained  by
the  Swabian  line,  they  sought  defence  in  the  course  of
policy  so  well  described  by  Machiavelli  when  he  remarks
that  the  Popes,  "  sometimes  for  the  love  of  religion,  at
others  to  forward  their  own  ambitions,  never  ceased  to
call  fresh  humours  into  Italy  and  stir  fresh  wars.  And
no  sooner  had  they  raised  a  prince  to  power  than  they
repented  and  sought  to  compass  his  ruin,  nor  would  they
consent  that  any  province  their  own  weakness  prevented
them  from  seizing  should  be  possessed  by  another." i^
Thus,  after  many  persistent  intrigues,  they  finally  decided
the  Angevins  to  undertake  an  expedition  against  Manfred,
and  for  the  conquest  of  the  Neapolitan  kingdom.

With  the  aid  and  benediction  of  Pope  Clement  IV.,
Charles  of  Anjou  brought  an  army  composed  not  only
of  his  own  subjects,  but  of  many  Italians,  among  whom
the   exiled  Florentine   Guelphs  were   some  of  the  most

distinguished  for  bravery. »  He  advanced  to  the  Nea-
pohtan  frontier,  and  near  Benevento,  on  February  26,
1266,  gave  battle  to  the  foe.  King  Manfred  fought
valiantly,  and  when  forsaken  and  betrayed  by  his  soldiery,
died  the  death  of  a  hero  on  the  field.  For  three  days,
vain  search  was  made  for  his  corpse  among  the  slain,
then  it  was  found,  and  carried  off  on  the  back  of  an
ass.  The  French  monarch  refused  Manfred  burial  in
consecrated  ground,  because  the  Pope  had  declared  him
excommunicate.  Accordingly  he  was  laid  in  a  ditch  by
the  bridge  of  Benevento,  where  the  French  soldiers,
casting  each  a  stone  on  the  corpse,  raised  a  pile  that
proved  a  fitting  monument  to  the  courage  and  ill
fortune  of  a  warrior  slain  sword  in  hand.  But  Pope
Clement  grudged  him  even  this  humble  grave,  and  at
his  command  the  Archbishop  of  Cosenza  persuaded  the
Angevin  monarch  to  have  the  corpse  exhumed,  and
thrown  beyond  the  frontier  of  the  Neapolitan  kingdom,
on  the  banks  of  the  river  Verde. 2  All  these  events
completed  the  overthrow  of  the  Ghibelline  party  in
Italy.     The  Imperial   throne  stood  vacant,  the  Suabians

'  It  is  said  that  Manfred,  on  witnessing  their  attack,  showed  his
admiration  for  their  courage  by  exclaiming,  "  Whoever  may  win  the
victory,  these  Guelphs  will  not  lose  it."

'  Dante  (Purgatorio,  iii,  121-32).  The  poet  places  Manfred  in
purgatory,  although  at  the  period  he  was  classed  as  a  heretic  together
with  the  Emperor  Frederic,  Farinata,  and  many  other  Ghibellines  :

*'  Orribili  furon  li  peccati  miei,
Ma  la  bontk  infinita  ha  si  gran  braccia
Che  prende  ci6  che  si  rivolve  a  lei.
Se  il  pastor  di  Cosenza,  che  alia  caccia
Di  me  fu  messo  per  Clemente,  allora
Avesse  in  Dio  ben  letta  questa  faccia,
L'ossa  del  corpo  mio  sarieno  ancora
In  co'  del  ponte  presso  a  Benevento,
Sotto  la  guardia  della  grave  mora.
Or  le  bagna  la  pioggia  e  move  il  vento,
Di  fuor  del  Regno,  quasi  lungo  il  Verde,
Ove  le  trasmut6  a  lume  spento.

were  crushed,  and  another  foreign  dynasty  succeeded  them
in  Naples,  summoned  thither  by  the  Pope.  If  Frederic's
decease  had  caused  the  decline  of  the  Ghibellines  in
Florence,  it  is  easy  to  imagine  what  was  to  befal  them
now  that  their  evil  sway  had  accumulated  such  increased
detestation  of  their  rule,  and  that  the  death  of  Manfred
not  only  deprived  them  of  a  friendly  sovereign,  but
extinguished  in  Italy  the  domination  of  an  Imperial  and
royal  line  that  had  been  their  strongest  support.

In  fact,  when  the  result  of  the  campaign  was  announced
in  Florence,  the  whole  population  was  moved  and  stirred
to  fresh  courage  against  the  nobles  still  holding  rule
over  them.  And  when  it  was  known  that  the  majority
of  the  Florentine  Guelphs,  who  had  done  such  brave
service  in  the  ranks  of  King  Charles,  were  returning  to
Florence  under  his  flag,  the  populace  seemed  so  ready
to  revolt  that  Count  Guido  and  his  followers  were
stricken  with  fear.  Therefore,  as  Machiavelli  says,
"  the  Ghibellines  judged  it  well  to  conciliate  by  some
acts  of  beneficence  the  people  they  had  hitherto  over-
whelmed with  injuries  ;  but  although  these  remedies
would  have  succeeded  had  they  been  applied  before  the
emergency  arose,  now,  on  the  contrary,  being  used  too
late,  not  only  failed  of  effect,  but  hastened  the  party's
ruin."  I  In  fact,  when  Count  Guido  and  the  Ghibelline
leaders  sought  to  pacify  the  people  by  certain  liberal
concessions  they  knew  not  where  to  begin.  The  old
laws  had  been  annulled,  and  these  men  had  so  completely
alienated  the  people  by  their  arbitrary  government  and
exactions,  that  no  concession  could  now  be  made  without
yielding  on  all  points.  On  the  other  hand,  the  people,
being  excluded  from  all  share  in  the  management  of  the
State,  had  turned  to  trade  and  commerce,  employing
therein  all  the  power  and  energy  they  were  forbidden  to

bring  to  bear  upon  politics.  Accordingly  all  branches
of  trade  were  marvellously  developed  and  organised
more  firmly  than  before  in  the  shape  of  politico-in-
dustrial associations,  entitled  Greater  and  Lesser  Guilds
{Arti  maggiori  ed  Arti  minori),  the  which,  dating  from
the  earliest  years  of  the  Middle  Ages,  had  gradually
become  significant  political  forces,  and  exercised  very
great  civic  influence.  Thus  many  new  powerful  families
had  arisen,  constituting  a  new  aristocracy,  as  it  were,  of
wealthy  traders,  or,  according  to  the  designation  already
bestowed  on  them,  of  popolant  grassi  (stout  burghers)
now  the  virtual  masters  of  the  Florentine  citizens.^
Gradually,  therefore,  the  Ghibellines  in  power  were
reduced  to  an  isolated  caste,  and  only  enabled  to  maintain
their  position  by  Manfred's  friendly  support  and  the
help  of  his  German  contingent.  Being  accordingly  in  the
attitude  of  invaders  encamped  on  alien  soil,  their  moral
and  political  ascendency,  their  civil  authority  daily
declined  ;  while  the  burghers  under  their  rule  had  won  by
means  of  trade  and  commerce  a  separate  world  for  them-
selves and  constituted  a  separate  body,  independent  to
some  extent  of  the  governing  authorities.  It  was  both
difficult  and  dangerous  to  seek  the  help  of  the  leading
burghers,  for  these,  being  chiefs  of  the  Guelph  population,
would  undoubtedly  insist  on  giving  the  latter  a  share
in  the  government,  the  which  would  lead  to  the  speedy
downfall  of  the  nobles  and  Ghibellines.     Neither  was  it

'  This  result  had  come  to  pass  at  a  much  earlier  period,  was  of
frequent  occurrence  in  Florentine  history,  and  was  now  more  assured
than  at  any  previous  time.  Malespini's  Chronicle,  chap.  104,  even
before  the  coronation  of  Frederic  II.,  refers  to  certain  families  who
"  were  beginning  to  be  prominent,  although  too  obscure  to  be  mentioned
a  short  while  ago.  .  .  .  The  Mozzi,  Bardi,  Jacopi  detti  Rossi,  Fresco-
baldi,  all  these  were  of  recent  creation,  inasmuch  as  they  were  still
merchants  and  of  petty  origin  :  likewise  the  Tornaquinci  and  Cavalcanti,
also  traders,  were  of  petty  origin,  and  the  same  may  be  said  of  the
Cerchi,  who  shortly  began  to  rise  higher  than  the  aforesaid."

easy  for  the  nobles  to  initiate  partial  reforms,  since  they
neither  knew  what  concessions  to  make,  nor  how  to
grant  any  at  a  moment  when  the  people  were  conscious
of  sufficient  strength  to  dominate  the  city.  It  was
accordingly  decided  to  summon  from  Bologna  two  knights
of  a  new  order  known  as  the  Frati  Gaudenti^  vyhose
mission  it  was  to  succour  widows  and  orphans  and
reconcile  hostile  parties.  Also,  as  a  visible  sign  of
impartiality,  one  of  the  chosen  knights  was  to  be  a
Guelph,  the  other  a  Ghibelline.  All  this  was  arranged
with  the  consent  and  almost  at  the  instance  of  Pope
Clement  IV.,  who,  being  of  Provencal  birth  and  a
strenuous  supporter  of  Charles  of  Anjou,  continually
addressed  imperious  missives  to  the  Florentines,'  as
though  the  Imperial  throne  being  vacant,  its  authority
had  devolved  upon  himself,  and  the  victory  gained  by
King  Charles   had   made  him  master   of  Florence.

But,  according  to  Villani's  account,  the  short-lived
order  of  Frati  Gaudenti  consisted  of  men  chiefly  devoted
to  their  own  pleasures,  and  little  fitted  for  the  serious
task  of  acting  as  Podesta  of  Florence,  and  promoting
novel  reforms  there.  This  was  so  evident  that  the  two
knights  speedily  saw  the  necessity  of  consulting  and
coming  to  an  understanding  with  the  guilds.  Therefore,
on  reaching  the  city,  they  made  their  abode  in  the  palace
of  the  Commune,  and  convoked  a  council  of  thirty-six
Guelph  and  Ghibelline  merchants.  The  members  soon
began  to  hold  daily  discussions  in  their  meeting-place,  the
court  of  the  Calimala,  or  Clothdressers'  Guild.  The
business  of  dressing  foreign  woollen  stufi^s  had  made  great
progress  in  Florence,  and  the  guild  was  more  powerful
than  any  of  the  others.     The  council  soon   agreed  that

the  first  measure  proposed  should  be  the  conversion  of
the  seven  greater  guilds  into  an  industrial  and  political
body,  with  special  banners,  weapons,  and  chiefs  of  its
own.  So  they  began  to  organise  all  the  details,  assigning
a  gonfalon  to  each  guild,  and  arranging  them  as  follows  :
Judges  and  Notaries  ;  Calimala,  or  Dressers  of  F'oreis-n
Cloth  ;  Woollen  Trade  ;  Money-changers  ;  Physicians  and
Druggists  ;  Silk  Trade,  and  Fur  Trade.  The  Ghibellines,
however,  foresaw  that  this  course  would  inevitably  lead
to  the  reconstruction  of  the  Primo  Popolo  under  another
name.  Accordingly  the  Uberti,  Lamberti,  Fifanti,  and
Scolari  decidedly  opposed  these  innovations,  and  impressed
Count  Guido  with  the  necessity  of  putting  a  stop  to  them
at  once  if  he  wished  to  keep  the  government  in  his  grasp.
This  being  precisely  what  the  count  most  desired,  he
instantly  sent  to  demand  aid  from  Ghibelline  cities.
Arezzo,  Sienna  Pisa,  Pistoia,  Colle,  and  San  Gimignano
contributed  some  cavalry,  which,  with  his  German  guard,
raised  his  forces  to  fifteen  hundred.  But,  although  these
troops  were  under  Count  Guide's  command,  they  were
also  at  his  expense  ;  his  Germans  were  already  clamouring
for  their  pay,  and  all  his  money  was  spent.  Accordingly,
while  still  negotiating  terms  of  agreement  with  the  people,
he  decided  to  levy  an  additional  income  tax  of  ten  per
cent,  in  Florence.  But  the  citizens  were  already  so
heavily  burdened  that  this  new  impost  was  more  than
small  fortunes  could  support.  The  people  were  already
weary  of  misgovernment,  and  much  irritated  by  the
count's  action  in  stripping  the  Communal  palace  of  its
armoury  to  enrich  his  own  castle  at  Poppi ;  also  being
encouraged  by  commercial  success  and  increasingly  hostile
to  the  Ghibellines,  they  now  made  vigorous  protest,  and
clearly  showed  their  readiness  to  fly  to  arms.  Then  the
Council  of  Thirty-six  tried  to  pacify  the  citizens,  and
acting  as  mediators,  proposed  to  undertake  the  collection

of  the  new  tax,  levying  it  in  such  wise  as  to  make  it  fall
chiefly  on  the  rich  and  powerful.

Just  then,  however,  the  nobles,  emboldened  by  the
arrival  of  reinforcements,  thought  the  moment  had  arrived
for  a  decisive  blow,  and  rose  to  arms  in  the  city.  The
Lamberti  took  the  initiative  by  rushing  to  the  Piazza,
sword  in  hand,  shouting,  "  Out  with  these  thieves,  the
Thirty-six  ;  let  us  cut  them  to  pieces  ! "  At  this  out-
cry all  shops  were  closed  ;  the  Thirty-six  broke  up  their
council,  and  the  people  rising  in  revolt  took  their  orders
from  them  and  from  the  consuls  of  the  guilds,  with
Giovanni  Soldanieri  as  their  leader-in-chief.  The  latter
was  a  patrician,  urged  by  personal  ambition  to  join  the
riot  at  the  head  of  the  people.  Concentrating  in  Piazza
St.  Trinita,  they  were  soon  attacked  by  Count  Guido
and  his  cavalry,  who  thought  to  make  short  work  of  them.
But,  on  the  contrary,  the  crowd  threw  up  barricades  and
made  a  stubborn  resistance,  while  such  a  storm  of  stones
and  darts  rained  down  from  windows  and  roofs  that  the
Germans  began  to  lose  heart,  and  the  count,  stricken  with
dismay,  ordered  his  standards  to  withdraw,  retreated  to
Piazza  St.  Giovanni,  and  then  hurrying  to  the  two
Gaudenti  in  the  Communal  palace,  demanded  the  keys
of  the  town  in  order  to  effect  his  escape.  Neither  his
friends'  supplications  nor  the  wrath  of  his  followers  could
persuade  him  that  the  danger  was  not  serious,  and  that
he  might  safely  remain  in  the  town.  He  was  so  be-
wildered by  fear  that,  having  obtained  the  keys,  he
insisted  on  being  escorted  by  three  of  the  Thirty-six,  lest
he  should  be  shot  from  some  window  by  the  way.  So,
on  St.  Martin's  Day,  November  ii,  1266,  he  left  Florence
by  the  so-called  Gate  of  the  Oxen,  and  fled  with  his
followers  to  Prato.

The  following  day,  being  cured  of  his  panic,  he  per-
ceived his  mistake,  and  by  the  advice  of   the  Florentine

Ghibellines  in  his  company  tried,  as  Machiavelli  puts  it,
"  to  recapture  by  force  the  city  he  had  forsaken  from
cowardice.""^  He  came  with  his  men  in  order  of  battle
as  far  as  the  Gate  by  the  Carraia  Bridge,  on  the  site
of  the  present  Borgo  Ognissanti  ;  but  the  people  who
could  have  scarcely  succeeded  in  expelling  him  before,
save  for  his  own  exaggerated  fears,  had  no  difficulty  in
repulsing  him  now.  When  the  count  demanded  admis-
sion with  a  mixture  of  threats  and  entreaties,  the  only
reply  was  a  shower  of  arrows  from  the  walls.  He  was
therefore  compelled  to  retreat,  and  his  men  were  so
enraged  and  humiliated  that  on  the  way  back  they  tried
to  capture  a  neighbouring  castle  in  order  to  prove  their
strength.  But  even  this  small  attempt  failed,  and  they
reached  Prato  more  humbled  than  ever,  and  with  much
dissension  in  their  ranks.  The  count,  convinced  of  the
hopelessness  of  recovering  the  state,  sought  refuge  in  the
Casentino,  and  the  Florentine  Ghibellines  dispersed  to
various  fortresses  and  mansions  about  the  contado.

The  Guelphs  were  now  masters  of  Florence.  They
set  to  work  at  the  changes  required  for  the  reorganisation
of  the  popular  government,  and  were  favoured  with  much
imperious  advice  from  the  Pope.  However,  they  only
gave  heed  to  his  epistles  in  sufficient  measure  to  avoid
exciting  his  wrath.  Their  first  act  was  the  dismissal  of
the  two  Gaudenii  friars,  whose  incapacity  had  been  well
proved  ;  their  next  to  request  Orvieto  to  furnish  them  with
a  Captain  of  the  people,  a  Podesta,  and  a  body  of  knights
to  guard  the  safety  of  the  Commune.  Accordingly  one
hundred  knights  arrived,  with  Messer   Ormanno  Monal-

•  Machiavelli,  "  Storie,"  lib.  ii.  p.  75.


224  STATE  OF  PARTIES.

deschl  as  Podesta,  and  a  Messer  Bernardini  as  Captain.
For  the  sake  of  peace  they  allowed  the  Ghibellines  to
return  to  Florence,  and  arranged  various  reconciliations
and  marriages  between  them  and  the  Guelphs,  hoping
thus  to  promote  unity  among  the  people  and  mitigate
party  hatred.  But,  in  the  still  heated  state  of  the  public
mind,  these  measures  only  excited  fresh  rancour.

At  this  juncture  Florence  seemed  to  have  lost  all  her
former  self  reliance,  so  that,  in  the  midst  of  the  grave
complications  of  Italian  politics,  even  the  Guelphs  felt
the  need  of  foreign  support.  It  was  a  fatal  habit,  first
owed  to  the  Ghibellines,  who,  in  token  of  respect  toward
the  Empire,  had  requested  the  presence  of  an  Imperial
vicar  in  Florence.  So,  now  that  the  people  had  won  the
victory  because  the  Angevins  had  succeeded  the  Suabian
line  on  the  Neapolitan  throne,  recurrence  to  the  same
perilous  measure  seemed  almost  unavoidable.  The  Pope,
with  an  assumption  of  Imperial  prerogative,  had  nominated
Charles  of  Anjou,  first  as  peacemaker,  and  then  as  actual
vicar-imperial,  in  Tuscany,  for  a  term  of  ten  years.  The
Florentines  considering  it  a  duty  to  conform  with  this
new  state  of  things,  and  even  to  accept  it  with  a  good
grace,  accordingly  offered  Charles  the  lordship  of  their
city  for  six  years,  a  term  afterwards  extended  to  ten.
But  either  because  the  conditions  attached  to  the  offer
were  distasteful  to  the  French  monarch,  or  because  he
wished  it  to  be  pressed  more  energetically,  he  certainly
showed  much  hesitation  in  deciding  to  accept  it.  Shortly
afterwards  he  despatched  to  Florence  Philip  de  Monfort,
who  made  his  entry  with  eight  hundred  knights  on  Easter
Day,  1267,  the  anniversary,  as  it  was  remarked  at  the
time,  of  Buondelmonti's  assassination.  The  king  subse-
quently sent  Guy  de  Monfort  as  his  vicar ;  ^  and  at  last

'  "  II  Codice  diplomatico  di  Carlo  I.  e  II.  d'Angio,"  published  by  Del
Giudice,  in  Naples,  serves  to  rectify  many  blunders  made  by  the
chroniclers  on  this  point.


FOURTH  CONSTITUTION  OF  THE  REPUBLIC.     225

came  in  person  to  lead  the  war  against  the  Ghibellines  in
Tuscany.

The  Ghibellines  being  now  expelled,  and  the  supremacy
of  Charles  accepted  as  an  accomplished  fact,  the  necessity
remained  of  establishing  the  government  of  Florence  on  a
definite  basis,  and  endeavouring  to  secure  its  freedom
amid  new  and  hazardous  complications.  To  this  end  the
fourth  constitution  of  the  Republic  was  evolved.  The
''state  of  Florentine  society  had  undergone  considerable
change,  and  this  implied  a  corresponding  change  in  the
character  of  the  new  constitution.  The  Ghibelline  or
patrician  party  was  now  reduced  to  a  small  number  of
nobles,  soldiers  by  profession,  and  eager  to  exercise
tyranny.  But,  as  we  have  seen,  almost  a  new  aristocracy
had  come  to  the  front,  composed  of  nobles,  who,  re-
nouncing their  titles  and  altering  their  names,  had  joined
the  popular  side,  and  likewise  of  well-to-do  burghers
{popolo  grasso),  who,  having  leapt  to  fortune  as  traders,
had  now  entered  a  new  sphere  of  civil  life,  and  dominated
the  city.  I  Another  point  to  be  noted  is  that  both
burghers  and  populace  were  rapidly  losing  their  aptitude
for  arms,  and  this  not  merely  because  in  all  wars  of  the
period  the  superiority  of  trained  soldiers  was  a  recognised
fact,  and  popular  armies  seen  to  be  of  small  use,  but
also  because  commerce  had  become  too  important  for
busy  traders,  engaged  in  their  shops  or  travelling  about
the  world,  to  be  able,  as  in  past  times,  to  spend  two  or
three  months  of  the  year  in  the  field.  Commerce  was
now  the  chief  occupation  and  almost  the  very  life  of  the
Florentines,  so  that  they  really  deserved  to  be  called  a
people  of  bankers  and  merchants.

In  addition  to  all  this  there  was  now  a  foreign  power

'  "  The  citizens  of  ancient  times  being  either  entirely  extinguished,
or,  at  least  decayed  by  age,  another  race  began  to  spring  up,  as  it  were,  in
a  n?w  city."    Ammirato,  "  Storie."

upheld  by  foreign  soldiery  in  Florence.  Whether  in  per-
son or  by  means  of  other  officials  of  his  own  nomination,
Charles  of  Anjou  filled  the  post  of  Podesta  of  the  city,
and  even  the  Captain  of  the  people  was  often  a  man  of  his
choice.  Therefore,  with  their  usual  sagacity,  the  Floren-
tines re-established  the  twelve  elders,  two  for  each  sestiere,
under  the  name  of  the  Twelve  Worthies,  as  advisers  to  the
Podesta.  Also,  in  place  of  the  Thirty-six,  they  constituted
a  council  of  one  hundred  worthies  of  the  people,  "  with-
out whose  sanction  no  important  measure  nor  any
expenditure  was  to  be  undertaken."  With  this  council
and  with  the  parliament,  which  legally,  at  all  events,
never  ceased  to  exist  in  Florence,  we  see  the  reconsti-
tution  of  a  central  and  popular  government,  limiting  the
authority  of  the  Angevin  Podesta.

It  was,  indeed,  almost  a  revival  of  the  old  consular
government  by  which  the  Podesta  and  Captain,  now  to  be
made  subordinate  to  it,  had  been  originally  raised  to
power.  Nor  did  matters  stop  at  this  point.  The  two
councils,  special  and  general,  of  the  Podesta  and  Captain
were  likewise  repristinated.  With  this  difference,  how-
ever, that  whereas  by  the  constitution  of  1250  the
Captain  of  the  people  had  been  second  in  command,  and
then  almost  abolished  under  the  Ghibelline  sway,  now  at
this  date  he  not  only  resumed  his  functions,  but  was  given
precedence  over  the  Podesta.

In  fact,  any  Bill  proposed  by  the  Twelve  to  the  Hundred
and  approved  by  the  latter,  was  passed  on  to  the  Captain's  i
two  councils,  in  the  first  place  to  his  special  council  of  the
capitudini — also  known  as  the  credenza — consisting,  as
formerly,  of  eighty  members.  Approved  by  this  assembly,
the  Bill  was  then  proposed  to  the  council  general  and  special
and  of  the  capitudini^  comprising  three  hundred  members.
As  a  rule,  all  the  three  councils  put  it  to  the  vote  the  same
day.     Then,  on  the  following  day,  the  Bill  was  presented


MA CHINER  Y  OF  GO  VERNMENT.  2 2 7

to  both  the  councils  of  the  Podesta,  first  to  the  special
council  of  ninety,  next  to  the  general  council  of  three
hundred,  sometimes  increased  to  390  by  deliberating
jointly  with  the  special  assembly.  We  know  very
little  regarding  the  mode  of  election  to  these  councils,
but  they  usually  lasted  six  months.  Nevertheless,  as  they
were  very  large  and,  on  the  other  hand,  the  number  of  the
citizens  was  small,  we  opine  that  all  eligible  persons — abili
a  sedere^  namely,  fully  qualified  citizens — must  have  been
chosen  in  turn.  It  should  also  be  added  that  projected
motions  were  neither  all  nor  invariably  submitted  to  every
one  of  these  different  councils.  Both  by  law  and  usage
the  magistrates  v/ere  often  privileged  to  recur  to  certain
councils  only,  even  as  they  were  allowed  the  right  of
assembling  a  preliminary  and  more  restricted  council  of
richiesti  (or  invited  persons),  composed  solely  of  officials
or  citizens  whose  experience  might  be  useful  in  drawing
up  the  required  schemes.  At  other  times  even  a  few  out-
siders were  invited  to  the  councils.  Thus,  for  instance,
when  affairs  of  war  were  under  discussion  the  presence
was  requested  of  those  charged  to  superintend  them.  The
statutes  were  neither  very  precise  nor  very  stringent  on
this  point.  Special  efforts,  however,  seem  to  have  been
used  to  put  checks  on  free  discussion,  possibly  to  prevent
the  multitude  of  councils  from  causing  undue  delay.  The
right  of  proposing  any  measure  or  decree  was  strictly
reserved  to  magistrates,  by  whom  some  notary  or
other  qualified  person  was  commissioned  to  support  it  in
their  name.  Save  in  very  grave  cases,  the  councillors  only
said  a  few  words  before  voting.  The  opposition  was
never  more  than  a  small  minority,  partly  because  every
project  brought  before  the  councils  had  been  already  sifted
several  times.  Later  on,  while  still  allowing  men  to  vote
against  the  magisterial  proposals,  no  one  was  permitted  to
speak  save  in  their  favour.     Hence,  in  spite  of  possessing


228  STATE  OF  PARTIES.

so  many  public  assemblies,  Italy  produced  no  real  political
oratory,  and  in  fact  our  literature  is  very  poor  in  this
branch  of  eloquence.  And  another  point  should  also  be
noted  here.  The  Council  of  One  Hundred  was  entirely
plebeian,  so  too  those  of  the  Captain  ;  on  the  other  hand,
nobles,  as  well  as  plebeians,  sat  in  the  Podesta's  councils.
The  capitudini^  or  guild-masters,  were  always  admitted,
as  we  have  shown,  to  the  Captain's  councils,  and  very  fre-
quently also  to  those  of  the  Podesta,  All  this  plainly
proves  that  the  democratic  party  and  the  greater  guilds
constituting  its  main  nucleus  were  decidedly  predomi-
nant,^    Thus,  although  King  Charles  obtained  the  lord-

'  There  are  so  many  discrepancies  among  Florentine  authorities
regarding  this  question  that,  after  careful  study  and  comparison  of  the
different  accounts  given  by  the  chroniclers,  we  have  chosen  Villani  as
our  guide.  He  is  the  most  celebrated  of  the  old  writers  and  the  nearest
to  the  times  described.  On  close  consideration  of  his  words  {vide
Villani,  lib.  vii.  chap,  xvi.)  we  see  that  the  councils  are  to  be  specified
as  those  of  the  Twelve,  of  the  Captain  and  of  the  Podestk.  But  reference
to  the  State  Archives,  the  Consulie,  or  first  volume  of  Provvisioni — dated
a  few  years  after  the  reform  of  which  we  speak — will  serve  to  prove  that
sometimes  the  Council  of  One  Hundred  was  assembled  ;  at  others  both
the  special  council  of  the  Captain  and  his  council-general  and  special
were  summoned  ;  sometimes  again  the  Podestk's  special  council — like-
wise styled  the  Council  of  Ninety — with  his  council-general  and  special,
amounting  in  all  to  390  members  (300  -f  90).  We  also  find  that  admit-
tance to  these  four  last-mentioned  councils  was  usually  granted  to  the
seven  masters  {capitudini)  of  the  greater  guilds,  and  that  in  course  of
time  the  number  of  the  masters  increased,  and  that  they  were  sometimes
summoned  to  meet  as  a  separate  council.  By  studying  the  number  of
votes  given  at  the  councils,  we  find  sufficient  proof  of  the  accuracy  of
Villani's  statements.  In  special  councils  the  voting  was  done  with  black
and  white  balls,  a  record  being  kept  of  their  respective  numbers.  But  at
that  period  general  councils  only  signified  their  verdict  by  standing  up
or  remaining  seated,  and  the  votes  were  not  recorded  in  writing.  But
regarding  these  points  the  rules  changed  as  circumstances  required,  for
the  magistrates  were  frequently  authorised  to  consult  whichever  couniils
they  preferred.

In  affairs  of  the  highest  importance,  and  in  discussions  carried  on  in  a
strictly  legal  way,  every  measure  proposed  had  to  be  first  approved  by
the  twelve  worthies,  who  were  likewise  allowed  to  ask  the  advice  of  con-
fidential private  persons,  afterwards  denominated  advisers  {richiesii).
The  proposal  was  next  submitted  to  the  One  Hundred,  then  to  tlie

restrictions  that  all  administrative  authority  remained
vested  in  the  people,  and  particularly  in  the  well-to-do

The  new  laws  examined  by  us  contain  very  few  allusions
to  Guelphs  and  Ghibellines,  many  to  nobles  and  people

to  wear  its  real  name,  and  plainly  signified  the  struggle
between  the  aristocracy  and  democracy.  Nevertheless,  the
Ghibelline  faction  still  survived  and  constituted  in  fact  the
aristocratic  party.  For  this  reason  the  people  desired  its
total  destruction,  and  another  clause  of  the  new  consti-
tution aimed  at  the  same  result.  A  list  was  drawn  up  of
all  who  had  suffered  persecution  from  the  Ghibellines
between  1260  and  1266,  together  with  an  inventory  of
their  confiscated  property.  The  number  of  victims  was
found  to  be  very  great,  and  their  losses  to  amount  to
the  then  enormous  sum  of    13?;  160,8,4   lire.'^      It   was

according  to  law  and  usage  the  former  should  not  have  been  convoked

way,  and  during  the  years   1268    and    1269   ^.bout   three
thousand  were  condemned,  including  contumacious  rebels,
and  as  many  sentences  of  confiscation  pronounced,  which
remained  enforced  for  a  long  period. ^     At  first,  all  confis-
cated property  was  collected  to  form  a  so-called  "  monte,"
or  fund  ;  then  afterwards  it  became  the  custom  to  divide
this  into  three  parts  :   one  to  the  Commune  ;  one  to  indi-
vidual   Guelphs    as    indemnity  for    past    losses ;  and  the
other  third  to  the  party,  in  order  to  strengthen  it  at  the
Ghibellines'  expense.      In  course  of  time,  however,  almost
all  confiscated  estates  were  granted  to  the  party  alone,  and
their  administration  entrusted  to  six  governors,  chosen  for
the  purpose,  three  of  whom  were  nobles  and  three  men  of
the  people.     These  ofiicials  were  originally  styled  consuls
of  the   knights,  then  captains  of   the   Guelph    party,  in
deference  to  the  ill-omened  counsels  of  Pope  Clement  IV.
and  Charles  of  Anjou.     As  every  important  magistracy  of
the  time  was  associated  with  two  councils,  so  the  Captains
of  the  party  also  possessed  a  special  or  privy  council  of
fourteen,  and  a  council-general  of  sixty  members.  2     The
Captains  kept  office  for  two  months,  and  held  their  sittings
in  the  Church  of  Sta.  Maria  sopra  Porta.      Later  on  they
had  a  palace  of  their  own,  and  were  entrusted  with  the

'  The  Giomale  Storico  degli  Archivi  Toscani^  anno  i.,  No.  i,  contains
"  Lo  Statuto  di  Parte  Guelta,"  of  1335,  edited  by  Bonaini,  whose  learned
commentary  on  the  same  appeared  in  subsequent  numbers.  Villani  tells
us  (vii.  17)  that,  "by  mandate  from  the  Pope  and  the  king,  the  said
Guelphs  nominated  three  knights  as  rectors  of  the  party."  But  this  must
be  a  blunder,  since,  according  to  the  statutes  of  the  party,  three  knights
and  three  men  of  the  people  were  named  to  the  office.  A  document
dated  December  12,  1268,  appended  to  Del  Lungo's  "Una  Vendetta  in
Firenze,"  mentions,  "  Uniis  de  sex  Capitaneis  Partis  Guelforuvt."  Villani,
in  the  same  chap,  xvii.,  confuses  Pope  Clement  with  Pope  Urban,  deceased
in  1264.  The  statute  of  1335  adds  a  third  council,  of  one  hundred,  to
the  others,  and  this  probably  served  the  same  purpose  with  regard  to  the
councils  as  that  fulfilled  by  the  parliament  to  the  Republic.


PRACTICAL  MERITS  OF  NEW  GOVERNMENT.    231

superintendence  of  public  works,  of  the  officials  of  the
Towers,  and  other  functions  of  a  similar  kind.  But  their
chief  duty  was  always  to  promote  the  cause  and  persecute
Ghibellines.  They  performed  their  task  with  so  much
zeal,  pursuing  their  adversaries  so  fiercely,  that  at  last  the
ruling  spirit  among  the  Captains  of  the  party  was  the
virtual  ruler  of  Florence.  By  excluding  all  opponents
from  public  posts,  sentencing  them  to  exile,  and  confis-
cating their  goods,  these  functionaries  rose  to  increasing
power,  and  injured  the  Republic  they  served.

Taking  a  general  view  of  the  new  constitution,  with
all  its  intricate  multiplicity  of  councils  and  magistracies,
our  first  impression  is  that  all  was  confusion  and  arbitrary
rule.  But  on  looking  more  closely  into  the  purpose  for
which  it  had  been  formed,  we  are  obliged  to  admit  that
this  government  was  singularly  well  adapted  for  success.
Civil  war  is  not  yet  stamped  out :  on  the  contrary,  must
undoubtedly  continue  for  a  long  time ;  democracy  is
pressing  on  towards  the  fulness  of  its  triumph  and  the
complete  destruction  of  the  aristocracy.  Nor  will  demo-
cracy be  satisfied  with  ousting  the  nobles  from  the  govern-
ment of  the  republics,  but  will  seek  to  deprive  them  of
life  itself,  and  this  is  only  to  be  accomplished  by  much
bloodshed  and  many  revolutions.

In  the  new  political  organisation,  the  central  power,  soon
to  be  changed  every  two  months,  occupies  a  very  feeble
position  compared  with  the  high  importance,  permanence,
and  strength  now  assigned  to  the  Podesta  and  the  Captain.
These  officers  are  at  the  head  of  the  Commune  and  the
people;  each  of  them  presides  over  two  councils:  they  are,
as  it  were,  the  chiefs  of  two  armed  and  hostile  republics.
But  in  that  of  the  people,  hitherto  the  weaker,  no  patri-
cian is  admitted  ;  while  in  that  of  the  Commune,  the
people  has  assumed  a  very  important  position  relatively
to  that  of  the  nobles,  and  therefore  has  legally  obtained

the  casting  vote  in  all  decisions,  notwithstanding  the
supremacy  virtually  exercised  by  Charles  of  Anjou  in
moments  of  the  gravest  emergency.  It  is  easy  to  foresee
the  bitterness  of  strife  to  be  engendered  by  this  state  of
things.  If  we  likewise  remember  that  this  Republic,  as
though  foredoomed  to  civil  uar,  included  so  important  a
magistracy  as  the  Captains  of  the  party,  apparently  created
for  the  sole  purpose  of  perpetuating  discord,  as  an  engine
of  war,  serving  to  keep  all  these  heterogeneous  forces  in
continual  agitation  and  promote  ceaseless  bloodshed  and
destruction,  we  can  understand  the  course  of  coming
events  in  Florence.  We  must  be  prepared  for  continual
struggles,  restless  changes  of  institutions  and  laws,  pre-
pared to  behold  webs  carefully  woven  one  month  pulled
to  pieces  before  the  next  moon  begins  to  wane.  Never-
theless, the  whole  machinery  of  the  government  was
singularly  fitted  to  compass  the  end  that  the  Republic
from  the  first  had  constantly  in  view.


IX.

Much  more,  however,  remains  to  be  said  in  order  to
give  our  readers  a  lucid  and  adequate  idea  of  the  Consti-
tution and  society  of  Florence  in  the  latter  half  of  the
thirteenth  century.  So  far  we  have  dwelt  too  slightly
on  the  most  important  detail  of  the  new  reforms — /.^.,the
organisation  of  the  guilds.  The  measures  suggested  for
this  purpose  by  the  Thirty-six  from  their  first  meetings  in
the  Calimala  Court,  and  against  which  the  nobles  had
most  strongly  protested,  were  speedily  approved  by  the
people,  and  from  that  moment  became  the  chief  basis  of
the  Florentine  statutes.  Associations  of  arts  and  trades
had  existed  throughout  Italy  from  a  very  early  date,  and
had  soon  attained  greater  development  in  Florence  than


PROSPERITY  OF  THE  FINE  ARTS.  233

in  other  communes.  For,  as  we  have  had  occasion  to
note,  the  whole  hfe  of  the  people  was  concentrated  in
these  associations  when  the  Ghibelline  tyranny,  upheld  by
Manfred,  excluded  the  lower  classes  from  participation  in
the  government  of  the  city.  Therefore  all  that  was  done
now  was  to  embody  naturally  evolved  results  in  a  more
regular  and  legal  shape.  Only  the  greater  guilds,  seven
in  number,  had  risen  to  any  really  great  political  impor-
tance in  1 260 ;  the  others  had  to  wait  much  longer  before
being  reorganised  on  the  same  footing.  What  was  the
position  attained  by  the  seven  greater  guilds  at  the  moment
we  are  now  studying  ?  By  devoting  our  attention  to  the
guild  that  was  first  and  foremost  in  the  race  it  will  serve
as  a  model,  and  enlighten  us  as  to  the  others.

At  the  period  of  which  we  treat  the  fine  arts  flourished
in  Italy  side  by  side  with  trade,  and  this  was  not  only
advantageous  to  the  national  culture,  but  already  enabled
our  manufactures  to  dictate  the  laws  of  taste  to  all  Europe.
In  those  times  Florence,  Milan, 't  and  Venice  set  the
fashions,  as  Paris  sets  them  now.  The  fine  Italian  taste
helped  to  create  the  Calimala  2  trade,  and  secured  its  rapid
prosperity.  This  trade  was  the  art  of  dressing  foreign
cloths — from  Flanders,  France,  and  England — and  dyeing
them  with  colours  known  to  Florence  alone.  Then,  in
their  finished  state,  these  stuffs  were  sent  to  all  the  Euro-
pean markets  stamped  with  the  mark  of  the  Calimala
Guild.  This  mark  was  highly  prized  as  a  proof  of  good
quality,  as  showing  that  the  exact  length  of  the  pieces
had  been  scrupulously  verified  in  Florence,  and  as  a
guarantee  against  any  falsification  of  material.  It  is
therefore  easy  to   see   why  the  Calimala  merchants  had

'  The  English  word  "milliner"  is  derived  from  Milan.

'  The  term  calimala  seems  to  have  been  taken  from  the  name  of  the
street  in  which  the  guild  was  situated.  The  street  led  to  a  house  of  ill-
fame,  hence  the  name  Calls  mains,  in  the  sense  of  Via  mala — evil  road  or
lane.


234  STATE  OF  PARTIES.

trading  relations  with  all  Europe,  and  interests  extending
to  every  place  where  civilisation  and  luxury  were  known.

Hence  the  necessity,  even  in  early  times,  of  choosing
directors  of  the  guild,  framing  statutes,  and  appointing
consuls  abroad  as  well  as  at  home,  to  protect  its  under-
takings. Now,  however,  with  the  newly  inaugurated
reforms,  the  Calimala,  together  with  the  other  greater
guilds,  was  constituted  on  the  lines  of  a  miniature  re-
pubHc.^

Every  six  months,  i.e.^  in  June  and  December,  the
heads  of  warehouses  and  shops  held  a  meeting,  and  this
Union — exercising  much  the  same  function  in  the  guild  as
that  of  the  parliament  in  the  Republic — chose  the  electors
to  be  charged  with  the  nomination  of  the  magistrates.
First  came  four  consuls,  who  administered  justice  accord-
ing to  the  statutes,  acted  as  representatives  of  the  guild,
and  ruled  it  with  the  assistance  of  two  councils,  one  being
a  special  council  with  a  minimum  of  twelve  members,  and
the  other  a  general  assembly  often  varying  in  number  and
sometimes  limited  to  eighteen.  With  the  consent  of  these
councils  the  consuls  were  even  empowered  to  alter  the
statutes.  They  carried  the  banner  of  the  guild,  and  in
emergencies  the  citizens  assembled  at  arms  under  their
command.  Then  there  was  the  camarlingo^  or  chamber-
lain, holding  office  for  one  year,  who  administered  the
revenue  and  expenditure  of  the  association.  And  even  as
the  Republic  had  a  foreign  magistrate  in  the  person  of  the
Podesta,  so  the  guild  had  one  also  in  the  person  of  its
notary,  likewise  appointed  for  one  year.  He  was  chosen
by  the  council-general,  had  to  speak  in  both  councils  as
the  representative  of  the  consuls  ;  was  often  employed  on

•  A  statute  of  the  Calimala  Guild,  dated  1332,  is  given  in  the  appendix
of  Giudici's  "  Storia  dei  Municipi  Italiani."  Another,  dated  1301-2,  has
been  published,  with  a  commentary  by  Dr.  Filippi,  "  II  piu  antico
Statute  deir  Arte  di  Calimala."  Turin  :  Bocca,  1889.  The  statutes

THE  CALIMALA  GUILD.  235

missions  for  the  guild,  and  was  specially  charged  to  enforce
scrupulous  observation  of  the  statutes,  with  the  power  of
inflicting  severe  punishment  on  all  violators  of  the  same,
were  they  even  the  consuls  themselves.     All  these  ofEcials
were  sworn  adherents  of  the  Guelph  party.     The  notary's
stipend  was  fixed  from  year  to  year.     The  consuls  were
bound  to  accept  office  if  elected,  and  could  not  be  re-
elected under  an  interval  of  one  year;  their  salary  was  first
fixed  at  ten  lire^  and  the  product  of  certain  fines  ;  but
was  afterwards  reduced  to  several  pounds  of  pepper  and
saffron,   and   a  few  wooden    baskets   and    spoons.     The
camarlingo^  or   camerario,   was    remunerated    even    more
slightly,  and  much  in  the  same  way.     Three  accountants
were  chosen  every  year  to  investigate  the  actions  of  the
outgoing     consuls,    camarlingo^    and    other    magistrates.
Twelve  statutory  merchants  were  similarly  elected,  with
authority  to  revise  and  improve  the  statutes  of  the  guild  ;
but  all  reforms  suggested  by  them  had  to  be  approved
first  by  both  councils,  and  then  by  the  Captain  of  the
people.     The  consuls  who,  under  the  title  of  capitudini^
took  part  in  the  councils  of  the  Captain  and  Podesta,  were
pledged  to  protect  the  interests  of  the  guild  and  advocate
laws  in  its  favour.     But  what  were  these  statutes  for  the
good  of  the  trade  of  which  so  many  magistrates  enforced
the  observance  ?     They  prescribed  fixed  rules  and  regula-
tions for  the  exercise  of  the  business.    Very  severe  punish-
ments were  enacted  when  the  merchandise  was  of  bad
quality,  defective,  or  counterfeit.     Every  piece  of  cloth
was  bound  to  be  labelled,  and  any  stain  or  rent  unrecorded
by  this  label  entailed  punishment  on  the  merchant  con-
cerned.    Above  all,  there  was  great  strictness  as  to  exact-
ness of  measure.     The   officers  of  the   guild  frequently
inspected  the  cloth,  and  made  a  bi-monthly  examination
of  the  measures  used  in  all  the  shops.     Models  of  the
perscribed  measures  were  exhibited  to  the  public  in  certain


236  STATE  OF  PARTIES.

parts  of  the  city.  Nor  was  this  all.  The  consuls  sent
delegates  to  every  counting-house  to  verify  the  merchants'
books  and  accounts,  and  punished  every  deviation  from
established  rules.  Every  guild  had  a  tribunal  composed
either  solely  of  its  own  members,  or  jointly  with  those
of  another,  for  the  settlement  of  all  disputes  connected
with  the  trade,  and  enforced  severe  penalties  on  all  who
referred  such  disputes  to  ordinary  courts.  It  may  be
asked  how  the  consuls  were  enabled  to  give  effect  to  their
verdicts .?  The  punishments  were  generally  fines,  and
persons  refusing  to  pay  them,  after  receiving  several
admonitions  and  increased  fines  if  still  recalcitrant,  were
excluded  from  the  guild  and  practically  ruined.  From
that  moment  their  merchandise,  being  unstamped,  was
no  longer  guaranteed  by  the  guild ;  they  also  lost  many
other  notable  advantages,  and  were  finally  unable  to  con-
tinue their  business  in  Florence,  and  not  often  elsewhere.
In  fact,  as  we  have  seen,  the  consuls  chosen  in  Florence
guarded  the  interests  of  the  guild  even  outside  the  State
by  deputing  vice-consuls  for  that  purpose  to  other  parts
of  Italy  and  Europe,  and  increasing  their  number  in  pro-
portion with  the  increase  of  their  commercial  relations.
The  two  more  important  consuls  abroad  were  those  in
France,  All  these  delegates  were  charged  with  even  the
choice  of  the  inns  to  be  frequented  by  the  members  of  the
guild.  Whenever,  according  to  the  usage  of  the  day,  any
state  exercised  reprisals  on  the  members'  goods,  the  con-
suls were  bound  to  assist  and  defend  them.  Thus,
wherever  he  might  be,  a  member  of  the  guild  was  sure
of  protection  from  every  sort  of  injury  or  loss.  The
guild  was  a  jealous  custodian  of  its  members'  rights,  and,
in  order  to  defend  them  in  foreign  countries  or  to  obtain
justice  for  injuries  received,  often  despatched  ambassadors
to  the  governments  concerned.^     This  was  an  invaluable

'  All  these  details  of  the  Calimala  Guild  are  to  be  found  in  the  statutes
cited  above.     We  have  quoted  from  the  earliest  statutes.

help  at  a  time  when  no  international  law  existed  for  the
protection  of  foreigners,  and  reprisals  were  continually
used.  Accordingly  merchants  found  it  better  to  submit
to  any  penalty  rather  than  be  dismissed  from  the  guild  ;
no  worse  threat  was  needed  to  enforce  obedience  to  the
statutes.  The  six  other  greater  guilds  were  all  governed
on  the  same  principle  as  the  Calimala.  Their  united  body
of  consuls  formed  the  capitudini^  and  these  were  after-
wards headed  by  a  proconsul,  a  magistrate  held  in  the
highest  esteem.

Putting  aside  the  immense  commercial  and  industrial
advantages  thar  this  organisation  of  the  guilds  afforded
to  the  Republic  during  the  thirteenth  century,  we  shall
see  that  they  were  equally  useful  from  the  political  point
of  view.  All  these  merchants,  constituting  a  large
majority  of  the  citizens,  were  continually  engaged  in
directing  great  undertakings,  settling  commercial  dis-
putes, discussing  statutes  and  laws ;  they  maintained
relations  with  all  parts  of  the  known  world,  and  travelled
to  all  parts  on  special  missions  in  defence  of  their  common
interests.  We  see  that  they  all  took  a  continuous  and
eager  share  in  political  life,  inasmuch  as  every  guild  was
an  independent,  self-ruling  institution,  with  separate
magistrates,  laws,  statutes,  and  councils,  and  that  it
became  a  centre  of  industrial,  intellectual,  and  political
activity.  Thanks  to  this  freedom  of  circulation,  the
pulse  of  the  Florentine  people  was  quickened  to
redoubled  strength,  and  every  faculty  of  the  human
mind,  all  moral  and  political  energy  of  which  man  is
capable,  suddenly  rose  to  a  prodigious  height  in  Florence.
Choosing  any  one  of  these  merchants  almost  at  random,
one  might  be  sure  to  find  him  capable  of  governing  the
Republic  ;  a  man  to  be  trusted  with  the  most  delicate  of
diplomatic  missions,  and  honourably  acquit  himself  of  it  ;
one  able  to  command  a  respectful  hearing  from  Pope,  king,

or  emperor,  without  allowing  himself  to  be  duped,  yet
without  failing  to  conform  to  the  requirements  of  court
ceremonial.  Thus  the  Florentines  rose  to  great  fame
throughout  Europe  for  their  shrewdness  and  subtlety,  and
as  in  the  midst  of  all  this  extraordinary  commercial  and
political  activity  Italian  art  and  literature  also  developed,
the  small  mercantile  Republic  soon  shed  its  lustre  over
the  whole  world.

The  greater  guilds  also  achieved  another  good  result
in  Florence.  At  a  time  when  the  State  organisation
divided  the  city  in  two  halves,  as  it  were  ;  at  a  time  when
the  strife  of  factions  was  about  to  be  fiercely  renewed,
when  party  leaders  excited  men's  passions  by  nourishincr
the  flame  of  discord,  and  the  continual  change  of  the
supreme  Council  of  Twelve  transferred  the  direction
of  the  government  to  citizens  of  all  tempers,  and  all
devoted  to  their  respective  parties,  then  the  decentralisa-
tion of  the  government  in  a  large  number  of  small  associa-
tions was  indeed  an  inestimable  benefit.  If  nobles  or
people  rebelled  against  their  rulers  in  order  to  change  the
Twelve,  or  the  Podesta,  the  Captain,  or  even  the  statutes,
the  suspension  of  public  business  that  inevitably  ensued
produced  much  less  real  than  apparent  confusion.  Bein^r
split  up  into  so  many  small  associations,  the  Republic
could  exist  without  a  government  even  for  several  months  ;
since  the  armed,  disciplined,  and  strongly  constituted  guilds,
were  now  even  better  prepared  than  in  past  times  to  seize
the  reins,  and  prevent  the  troubles  which  would  have
certainly  befallen  the  city  had  it  been  left  without
guidance.  Thus  the  constitution  of  the  guilds,  as
established  in  1266,  likewise  serves  to  explain  how  it  was
that  poetry,  painting,  sculpture,  and  architecture  were
enabled  to  flourish  am.ong  a  people  of  traders  ;  even  as  it
explains  why  so  much  progress  was  possible  amid  such,
apparently,    enormous    confusion,    and    how    democracy


REPUBLICAN  CULTURE,  239

succeeded  In  destroying  every  relic  of  feudalism  in
Florence,  and  in  achieving  absolute  equality  together
with  the  highest  degree  of  freedom  known  to  the  Middle
Ages.  The  Florentine  Commune  was  the  centre  of  so
much  culture  because  it  was  also  the  seat  of  the  largest
freedom  compatible  with  the  times.  Of  this  culture  the
best  and  loveliest  fruits  are  owed  to  the  democracy  ;
for  we  find  in  Arnolfo's  towers  and  churches,  in  the
paintings  of  Cimabue  and  Giotto,  as  also  in  Dante's  verse,
the  special  stamp  and  characteristic  of  the  Florentine
people.  During  the  Middle  Ages  in  Provence,  France,
Germany,  and  England,  many  nobles  rose  to  literary
fame,  and  indeed  nearly  all  the  poets  of  those  lands  were
of  patrician  birth.  But  Florentine  art  and  letters,  con-
stituting the  most  fertile  seeds  of  art  and  letters  in  Italy,
were  essentially  republican  ;  many  writers,  and  most  of
the  artists,  of  Florence  were  the  offspring  of  traders  or
labouring  men,        \

FTER  the  death  of  Frederic  II.,  the
Imperial  throne  long  remained  vacant.
For  twenty-three  years  no  king  of  the
Romans  was  definitively  proclaimed  in
Germany,  and  sixty-two  years  elapsed
before  any  prince  came  to  Rome  to
assume  the  crown  of  the  Empire.  Therefore  during  this
interval  the  Ghibelline  party  was  left  to  its  own  re-
sources, and  its  leaders  tried  to  maintain  their  feudal
rights  by  employing  their  forces  and  prestige  against
all  communes  and  small  potentates  enjoying  no  chance
of  gaining  the  Imperial  protection.  Hence  petty
tyrants  began  to  arise  on  all  sides,  Ghibelline  lords  for
the  most  part,  who,  notwithstanding  the  many  defeats
endured  by  the  aristocracy  in  Italy,  derived  new  and
unexpected  advantages  from  the  changed  conditions  of
the  times.  Another  factor  of  this  result  was  the  new
mode  of  warfare.  Men-at-arms  were  now  the  chief
strength  of  an  army,  and  these  mounted  soldiers,  cased  as
well  as  their  horses,  in  heavy  armour  and  armed  with  long

was  required  for  cavalry  service,  and  it  was  increasingly
difficult  for  artisans  or  merchants  to  pursue  the  military
career  to  any  effect,  whereas  war  was  becoming  the
chief  occupation  of  the  nobles.  In  fact,  many  of  the
leading  patricians  were  acquiring  a  reputation  in  the  new
mode  of  war,  gaining  followers,  and  by  taking  the  com-
mand of  small  companies  gradually  rising  to  power,  and
aspiring  to  become  tyrants.  For  this  and  other  reasons,
to  be  made  clearer  farther  on,  nearly  all  the  Lombard
cities,  and  some  of  those  in  Central  Italy,  were  now  losing
their  independence.

The  same  ambitions  doubtless  existed  among  the
Guelphs,  but  the  feudal  aristocracy  had  far  less  influence
in  their  party,  the  majority  of  which  consisted  of  mer-
chants and  wealthy  men  of  the  people.  Besides,  the  Pope
was  a  near  neighbour  during  the  interregnum  of  the
Empire,  the  Guelph  cities  were  at  the  same  time  under
the  dangerous  protection  of  an  ambitious  pontiff,  and  that
of  the  equally  ambitious  Charles  I.  of  Anjou,  peacemaker
and  vicar-imperial  of  Tuscany.  Charles  nominated  the
Podesta  of  every  Guelph  Tuscan  city,  and  whenever  he
failed  to  appear  in  person,  sent  a  representative,  called  by
the  chroniclers  a  royal  maliscalcOy  with  an  escort  of  some
hundred  horse  and  foot.  Pisa,  Arezzo,  and  all  other
Ghibeliine  cities  refusing  to  acknowledge  his  authority,
were  exposed  to  continual  threats  from  without,  and
lacerated  within  their  walls  by  the  attacks  of  would-be
tyrants.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Guelph  cities  lived  in
continual  terror  of  the  king's  ambitious  designs  ;  but
Charles's  position  was  not  sufficiently  assured  for  him
to  be  able  to  use  his  temporary  and  limited  office  as  a
pretext  for  asserting  sovereign  power  over  Tuscany,
although  such  was  his  secret  aim.      For  the  moment  it

was  enough  to  play  the  part  of  high  protector  of  all
civic  rights  and  privileges,  so  that  the  Guelph  cities
might  be  tricked  into  counting  on  his  help  both  against
Ghibelline  attacks  from  without  and  internal  treason  in
favour  of  tyranny.

The  Florentines,  however,  were  not  easily  hoodwinked
regarding  either  future  or  present  events.  They  had
asked  Charles  to  accord  them  his  protection,  but  only
within  certain  limits,  which,  at  any  cost,  they  were  deter-
mined should  not  be  overstepped.  They  too  nourished  a
secret  aim — namely,  to  use  the  king's  forces,  not  for  the
increase  of  his  power,  but  towards  the  establishment  of
their  own  supremacy  in  Tuscany.  The  authority  of  the
Empire  was  much  diminished  in  Italy  ;  the  temporal
strength  of  the  Papacy  was  also  on  the  wane,  and  the
Communes,  realising  their  greater  independence,  hastened
to  enlarge  their  respective  territories.  All  Italian  cities
now  had  this  end  in  view.  But  if  one  city  waxed  power-
ful, all  its  neighbours  had  either  to  pursue  the  same
course  or  become  its  prey.  Thus  there  was  continual
war  between  this  and  that  city,  less  from  party  strife  or
jealousy  than  in  necessary  defence  of  their  own  interests.
Besides,  with  the  new  custom  of  hiring  foreign  soldiers  and
captains  of  adventure,  any  one  with  gold  at  his  command
could  quickly  collect  a  powerful  force  and  attack  some  of
his  neighbours.  Hence  every  city  or  state  had  to  be
always  on  the  alert  and  continually  enlarging  its  strength
and  power.  It  was  for  this  purpose  that  the  Florentines
now  resolved  to  turn  to  account  the  authority,  prestige,
and  forces  of  King  Charles.

GUELPH  SUCCESSES.  243

with  eight  hundred  French  knights,  arrived  in  Florence,  a
Florentine  army,  composed  of  recruits  from  two  sestieri
of  the  city,  in  junction  with  the  French  cavalry  under
Montfort,  immediately  marched  to  the  siege  of  St.  Ilario,
or  St.  Ellero,  in  which  castle  a  number  of  Ghibellines  had
sought  refuge  with  their  leader,  Filippo  da  Volognano.
The  castle  was  taken,  and  its  eight  hundred  Ghibelline
defenders  were  all  either  killed  or  captured.^  They  com-
prised many  members  of  the  highest  Florentine  nobility,
Uberti,  Fifanti,  Scolari,  &c.,  and  party  hatred  was  then
so  fierce  that  a  youthful  scion  of  the  Uberti,  finding
surrender  inevitable,  threw  himself  from  the  top  of  a
tower  to  avoid  falling  into  the  hands  of  the  Buondel-
monti.2  In  the  course  of  this  campaign  the  castles  of
Campi  and  Gressa  were  captured  ;  and  many  cities,
including  Lucca,  Pistoia,  Volterra,  Prato,  San  Gimignano,
and  Colle,  being  won  over  to  the  Guelph  cause  by  the
expulsion  of  their  Ghibellines,  joined  the  Florentines  in
the  League,  or  Taglia,  commanded  by  the  French
marshal.

Pisa  and  Sienna  still  remained  Ghibelline  ;  the  former
had  always  been  and  still  continued  to  be  the  strongest
bulwark  of  the  party  in  Tuscany  ;  the  latter  had,  as  usual,
given  refuge  to  the  banished  Ghibellines  of  Florence,  and
also  to  some  of  Manfred's  Germans  who  had  escaped  the
massacre  of  Benevento.  The  Florentines  had  not  yet
suceeded  in  revenging  the  rout  of  Montaperti,  and  were
burning  to  pluck  this  thorn  from  their  side  ;  while  King
Charles,  equally  eager  for  the  destruction  of  all  surviving
friends  and  supporters  of  the  Suabian  line,  was  preparing

'  Villani,  vii.  ig.  The  frequent  mention  of  eight  hundred  knights  by
the  chroniclers  of  this  period  excites  doubts  as  to  their  accuracy.  It  is
never  safe  to  accept  their  statements  regarding  the  number  of  this  or
that  army.  Probably  eight  hundred  horse  was  a  species  of  regulation
number,  signifying  a  squadron  of  French  men-at-arms.

to  come  to  Tuscany  to  lead  the  war  against  Sienna  in
person.  Pending  his  arrival,  the  Florentines,  after  an
abortive  attack  on  the  city,  laid  waste  the  surrounding
territory,  and  finding  that  the  exiles,  the  Germans  and
other  Ghibellines,  were  entrenched  at  Poggibonsi,  marched
against  that  town  with  the  French  contingent  and  the
Guelphs  of  the  Taglia^  and  began  preparations  for  a
regular  siege.  At  the  same  time  King  Charles  entered
Florence,  and  was  naturally  welcomed  with  great  joy.
All  the  chief  citizens  went  forth  to  meet  him,  with  the
CarrocciOy  as  a  sign  of  the  highest  honour,  and  after
spending  a  festal  week  in  the  city  and  raising  several
persons  to  the  knighthood,  the  king  repaired  to  the  camp
before  Poggibonsi.  The  siege  lasted  four  months,  and
then,  towards  the  middle  of  December,  1267,  the  strong-
hold was  driven  to  surrender  by  famine.  Charles  left  a
Podesta  there  to  govern  in  his  name,  and  began  to  build
a  fortress,  providing  for  that  expense,  in  his  accustomed
way,  by  levying  heavy  taxes  from  the  cities  of  the  League.
Florence  had  to  contribute  1,992  lii-e.  After  this,  the
army  was  immediately  marched  against  Pisa.  The  reduc-
tion of  this  powerful  and  warlike  republic  proved  no
easy  task  ;  the  king  had  to  be  satisfied  for  the  time  with
humiliating  it,  by  seizing  Porto  Pisano  and  levelling  the
towers  there.  In  February,  1268,  he  repaired  to  Lucca,  '
and  marching  thence  to  the  siege  of  Mutrone,  captured
that  castle  and  gave  it  to  the  Lucchese.  Thus,  by  a
series  of  small  victories,  which,  although  of  slight  impor-
tance, were  achieved  with  dazzling  rapidity,  he  greatly
raised  the  authority  and  prestige  of  the  Guelph  party,
which  had  not  only  contributed  troops  to  the  war,  but
borne  its  entire  expense,  granting  all  the  large  sums  of
money  continually  demanded  by  their  imperious  pro-
tector. In  fact,  by  the  end  of  February,  1268,  Florence
alone  had  disbursed  no  less  than  seventy-two  thousand  lire^


PRINCE  CONRADIN.  245

twenty  thousand  of  which  were  devoted  to  the  reduction
of  Poggibonsi,  although  Charles  had  not  fulfilled  his
promise  of  erecting  a  fortress  there.  But  at  this  moment
a  war-cry  was  raised,  stirring  all  Italy  to  alarm,  and  the
monarch  was  suddenly  threatened  by  so  imminent  a  peril,
that  after  some  hesitation  he  was  compelled  to  decide  on
flying  to  the  defence  of  the  Neapolitan  kingdom.


II.

Prince  Conradin,  son  of  Conrad,  and  grandson  of
Frederic  II.,  was  the  last  representative  of  the  Suabian
line  in  Germany,  and  the  last  hope  of  the  Ghibellines  in
Italy.  He  was  rightful  heir  to  the  crown  of  Naples  that
Charles  of  Anjou  had  forcibly  usurped ;  and  in  many
quarters  he  was  regarded  as  the  future  emperor  of
Germany.  On  attaining  the  age  of  fifteen  years,  numerous
exiles,  from  Naples,  Sicily  and  other  parts  of  Italy,  sought
his  presence,  imploring  him  to  reconquer  his  kingdom
and  restore  the  Imperial  party  in  Italy.  Conradin  was  a
youth  of  precocious  intelligence,  full  of  ardour  and
ambition ;  so,  fired  by  this  flash  of  hope,  he  instantly
resolved  to  cross  the  Alps.  Selling  what  little  property
remained  to  him,  and  collecting  the  most  devoted  of  his
adherents,  he  gathered  a  small  army  and  entered  Verona
on  the  20th  of  October,  with  three  thousand  horse  and
a  considerable  number  of  infantry.  From  this  city  he
despatched  letters  to  all  the  Christian  powers,  recounting
his  misfortunes  :  the  injuries  inflicted  on  him  by  the
usurpation  of  King  Charles  and  the  hatred  of  Pope
Urban  IV.,  who,  not  content  with  summoning  a  French
pretender  to  trample  on  the  Imperial  rights,  had  gone  to
the  length  of  excommunicating  the  legitimate  heirs  of  the
Empire  itself.      By  way  of   reply,  Pope  Clement    now


246         THE  DOMINANT  POWER  IN  TUSCANY.

renewed  the  sentence  of  excommunication  on  Conradin,
tried  to  stir  all  the  powers  against  him  by  means  of
violent  and  venomous  epistles;  and  wrote  pressingly  to
Charles,  now  waiting  to  give  battle  in  Tuscany,  bidding
him  hasten  to  defend  his  kingdom  from  the  threatened
and  imminent  danger.  In  fact,  the  Ghibelline  movement
was  now  spreading  throughout  Italy.  Pisa  and  Sienna  were
roused  to  great  hopes,  for  the  cities  of  Romagna,  Naples,
and  especially  of  Sicily,  had  all  risen  against  the  French.
By  April,  1268,  Conradin  was  already  in  Pisa  with  his
army,  and  numerous  adherents  flocked  to  his  standard,
although  the  emptiness  of  his  purse  had  caused  some  of
the  Germans  to  desert.  By  this  time  Charles  had  reached
Naples,  was  making  preparations  for  defence,  and  laying
siege^  to  Lucera,  where  Manfred's  Saracens  had  hoisted  the
Suabian  flag.  Conradin  was  ready  to  fly  thither,  without  ^
even  halting  in  Tuscany  to  encourage  the  cities  revolted
in  his  favour.  Pisa  and  Sienna  openly  sided  with  him  ;
Poggibonsi  had  promptly  thrown  ofl^  the  Florentine  yoke  ;
and  other  places  were  preparing  to  do  the  same.  Mean-
while, the  German  troops  at  once  directed  their  march  on
Rome,  where  the  Senator  Errico  of  Castile  was  awaiting
them.  The  French  in  Florence  sallied  forth  to  intercept
their  passage,  but  were  driven  back  with  heavy  loss,  to
the  great  encouragement  of  Conradin  and  his  followers.

But  the  prince's  fate  was  to  be  decided  by  the  battle
of  Tagliacozzo,  fought  near  the  banks  of  the  Salto  on
August  23,  1268.  At  the  beginning  of  the  engagement
Charles's  inferior  forces  seemed  almost  routed,  so  that  the
German  horse  rode  forward  on  all  sides  in  pursuit.  But
while  all  were  scattered,  riding  down  and  pillaging  their
retreating  foes,  Charles  suddenly  fell  on  them  with  the
reserve  of  eight  hundred  horse  he  had  kept  in  ambush,  I
and  quickly  turned  the  fortunes  of  the  day.  The  same
evening,  in  a  frenzy  of  delight,  he  announced  his  victory


CONRADIN  IN  THE  HANDS  OF  KING  CHARLES.     247

to  the  Pope,  who  was  equally  exultant.  The  prisoners
were  treated  with  unparalleled  cruelty,  being  mutilated,
beheaded,  or  even  burnt  alive.  Conradin  escaped  with
about  five  hundred  men,  and  escorted  by  Henry  of
Austria,  Galvano  Lancia,  Count  Gherardo  Donatico  of
Pisa,  and  other  devoted  friends,  made  for  Rome.  But
being  then  deserted  by  most  of  his  followers,  he  had  to
fly  to  the  Maremma  and  seek  shelter  in  the  Castle  of
Astura.  But  here,  by  the  sea,  when  on  the  point  of
embarking  for  Sicily  with  a  handful  of  friends,  he  was
seized  by  Giovanni  Frangipani,  lord  of  Astura,  who
handed  him  over  to  Charles,  and  was  rewarded  by  grants
of  land.

The  French  monarch  hastened  to  manifest  his  joy  by
renewed  acts  of  cruelty.  It  is  said  that  one  of  the
towers  of  Corneto  was  garlanded  with  the  corpses  of
some  of  the  most  distinguished  and  valiant  Ghibellines.
In  all  the  Neapolitan  cities  he  excited  the  populace  to  the
fiercest  excesses  against  the  nobles  of  Conradin's  party.
And  his  ministers  in  Sicily  outrivalled  one  another  in
ferocity,  for  it  is  said  that,  among  other  barbarities,  so
many  unhappy  Sicilians  Vv^ere  put  to  death  in  one  day  at
Augusta,  that  the  executioner  became  exhausted  with
fatigue,  and  wine  was  poured  down  his  throat  to  give
him  strength  to  continue  the  slaughter.  But  the  king's
ferocious  mind  was  chiefly  devoted  to  considering  what
should  be  Conradin's  fate.  To  murder  thousands  of
fellow  Christians,  and  let  them  die  amid  the  worst
torments,  was  a  matter  of  very  slight  consequence  to
him  ;  but  where  a  victim  of  royal  and  Imperial  blood
was  in  question,  he  felt  obliged  to  hesitate  a  little.
In  fact,  it  is  said  that  he  sought  counsel  from  the  Pope  ;
but  then,  without  waiting  the  reply,  he  sought  to  give  an
honest  colour  to  his  revenge  by  investing  it  with  a  false
air  of  legality.      He  presumed  to  treat  the  rival  whose


248         THE  DOMINANT  POWER  IN  TUSCANY.

throne  he  had  usurped  as  one  who  had  rebelled  against
a  legitimate  sovereign,  and  to  treat  a  prisoner  of  war  as
a  criminal  guilty  of  high  treason,  and  justly  responsible
for  all  the  excesses  of  the  German  soldiery  during  the
campaign.  Yet,  although  the  tribunal  consisted  of  foes
of  the  Hohenstauffen  selected  by  the  king,  some  of  its
members  spoke  nobly  in  Conradin's  defence.  It  was
affirmed  that  Guido  du  Suzzara,  a  juris-consult  of  Emilia,
renowned  in  his  day,  pleaded  the  youthfulness  of  the
accused,  his  belief  in  his  own  right  to  the  Neapolitan
crown,  the  motives  of  the  campaign.  It  was  also
reported  that  many  of  the  judges  remained  silent,  and
that  one  alone  openly  declared  against  the  prisoner.  But
all  was  in  vain.  Charles,  who  had  already  put  some  of
the  barons  to  death,  and  forced  one  of  them,  Count
Galvano  Lancia,  to  witness  the  strangling  of  his  own
son  before  being  executed,  never  intended  the  trial  to  be
more  than  a  sham,  so,  choosing  to  interpret  the  judges'
silence  as  a  sign  of  consent  to  the  prince's  death,  gave
sentence  accordingly.  The  verdict  was  communicated  to
Conradin  in  prison  while  he  was  playing  chess  with  his
cousin  Frederic  of  Austria.  On  October  29,  1268,
both  were  lead  to  the  scaffold  on  the  Market  Place  at
Naples.  The  protonotary  Roberto  di  Bari,  counsel  for
the  prosecution,  read  the  sentence  aloud,  in  the  presence
of  the  exultant  King  Charles.  It  is  asserted  that  even
many  of  the  French  were  stirred  to  rage  and  humiliation
by  this  cruel  scene.  An  immense  throng  filled  the  Piazza,
and  many  fell  on  their  knees  touched  with  pity.  Conradin
removed  his  cloak,  glanced  at  the  silent  people,  threw
his  glove  to  them,  as  an  augury  of  vengeance  in  time  to
come,  and  then  submitted  his  neck  to  the  axe.  Thus
died  the  Emperor  Frederic's  heir,  the  last  of  the  Suabian
line.  Frederic  of  Austria  tried  to  kiss  his  cousin's  head,
but  was  instantly  seized  by  the  executioner  and  put  to


PRINCE  CONRADIN'S  TRAGIC  END.  249

the  same  death.  Many  details,  either  historical  or  legen-
dary, are  added  by  the  chroniclers  in  describing  this
dismal  tragedy.  Although  a  Guelph,  Villani  believed
the  false  rumour  (vii.  29)  to  the  effect  that  Count  Robert
of  Flanders,  son-in-law  to  Charles,  on  hearing  the
sentence  read  by  di  Bari,  was  moved  to  such  fury  that
he  drew  his  sword  and  slew  the  protonotary  forthwith
before  the  king's  eyes.  At  least,  this  tale  serves  to  show
what  was  the  general  impression  produced  by  the  deed.
Opinions  vary  as  to  the  Pope's  share  in  the  tragedy.  It
is  certain  that  he  beheld  it  in  silence.  ^


III.

Although  these  events  excited  general  and  very  severe
condemnation  in  Italy,  they  wrought  immediate  benefit  to
Charles  and  the  Guelphs.  The  Florentines  profited  by
the  opportunity  to  launch  new  sentences  against  the
Ghibellines,  and  shortly  afterwards  prepared  to  make
fresh  attacks  on  their  neighbours,  and  particularly  on
Sienna.  For  they  still  yearned  to  avenge  the  defeat  at
Montaperti,  and  were  now  additionally  irritated  by  seeing
their  exiles  again  flocking  to  Sienna,  and  heartily  wel-
comed there.  They  also  held  that  city  responsible  for
the  recent  revolt  of  Poggibonsi,  and  their  action  in
devastating  the  latter's  territory  sufficed  to  start  hostili-
ties afresh.  The  hopes  of  the  Siennese  had  been  greatly
inflamed  by  Conradin's  passage,  and  even  now  they  were
not  disposed  to  be  easily  worsted.  The  chief  ruler  of  the
city  was  still  Provenzano  Salvani,  one  of  those  who  had
advised  the  battle  of  Montaperti  and  given  notable  proofs
cf  valour   in  the  fight.     Since   then   his   fame  had  been

degli  Imperatori  di  Casa  Sveva,    lib.  x.

increased  by  many  noble  deeds.  It  was  said  that  when
a  friend  of  his  was  seized  by  King  Charles  and  condemned
to  pay  a  fine  of  ten  thousand  crowns  in  exchange  for  his
life,  Provenzano  came  to  the  rescue,  and  as  neither  he  nor
the  prisoner's  kindred  could  contrive  to  pay  the  ransom,
he  stretched  a  carpet  on  the  Piazza  and  stood  there,
asking  public  alms  for  his  friend  until  the  required  sum
was  collected.  Consequently  he  had  great  influence  with
the  people,  was  a  Ghibelline  and  the  declared  enemy
of  Florence.  Sienna  likewise  contained  a  considerable
number  of  Spaniards  and  Germans,  old  soldiers  of  the
Ghibelline  wars,  and  there  was  also  Count  Guido  Novello,
who,  although  of  little  worth,  continually  agitated  in
favour  of  hostilities.  Thus  an  army  was  recruited,  con-
sisting, Villani  says,  of  fourteen  hundred  horse  and  eight
thousand  foot,  and  this  force  besieged  the  Castle  of  Colle
in  Val  d'Elsa,  as  a  reprisal  for  the  devastation  of  Poggi-
bonsi.  Thereupon  the  Florentines  took  the  field  with
a  small  body  of  infantry,  led  by  the  vicar  of  King
Charles,  and  eight  hundred  horse,  and  notwithstanding
their  inferiority  of  numbers  advanced  against  the  Siennese,
gave  them  battle  (June  17,  1269),  and  achieved  their
defeat.  Count  Guido  Novello  secured  his  safety,  as
usual,  by  flight  ;  but  Provenzano  Salvani  justified  his
fame  by  dying  sword  in  hand.  His  head  was  carried
round  the  field  on  the  point  of  a  spear.  This  was  the
fulfilment  of  a  prophecy  made  to  him  before  the  battle  :
'*  Thy  head  shall  be  the  highest  in  the  field,"  although  he
had  interpreted  the  saying  as  an  omen  of  success.  The
Siennese  received  no  quarter  from  their  foes,  who  returned
home  in  triumph,  and  thinking  they  had  now  avenged  the
rout  of  Montaperti,  began  negotiations  for  peace.  The
first  condition  exacted  was  that  Sienna  should  no  longer
harbour  Ghibelline  refugees,  who,  in  fact,  were  soon  com-
pelled to  depart  and  wander  from  place  to  place,  every-

where  exposed  to  persecution  and  cruelty.  Among  others
were  the  V2a.TA,  who,  having  excited  the  Castle  of  Ostina
to  revolt,  were  seized  and  hacked  to  pieces.

After  a  devastating  raid  on  Pisan  territory,  executed  by
the  Florentines  and  Lucchese,  Pisa  signed  a  treaty  of
peace  with  Charles  in  April,  1270.  Florence  herself
concluded  an  alliance  with  that  republic  on  the  2nd  of
May,  stipulating  almost  the  identical  terms  and  the  same
politico-commercial  agreements  previously  arranged  by  the
peace  of  1256.'  Just  at  that  time  Azzolino,  Neracozzo,
and  Conticino  degli  Uberti,  together  with  a  knight  named
Bindo  dei  Grifoni,  left  Sienna  to  take  refuge  in  the  Casen-
tino,  and  were  captured  by  the  Florentines  on  the  way.
The  latter  asked  Charles  what  should  be  done  with  these
prisoners,  and  he  replied,  that  they  were  to  be  punished
as  traitors,  save  Conticino  the  youngest,  who  was  to  be
sent  to  him.  The  others  were  speedily  beheaded,  by
order  of  the  Podesta  Berardino  d'Ariano  (May  8,  1270).
It  is  related  that  on  nearing  the  scaffold  Neracozzo  said
to  Azzolino  :  "  Whither  are  we  going  ?  "  To  which  his
kinsman  quietly  replied  :  "  To  pay  a  debt  bequeathed  us
by  our  fathers."  Conticino  perished  m  a  Capuan  dungeon.
This  instance  clearly  proves  the  great  supremacy  exercised
by  Charles  over  the  Commonwealth.  But  the  Florentines
were  willing  to  tolerate  anything  from  him  in  order  to
assure  their  predominance  In  Tuscany  by  his  help,  and
restore  the  prestige  of  the  Guelph  party.  The  latter  aim
was  already  practically  achieved,  for  all  Tuscany  now
adhered  to  the  Guelphs,  and  both  old  and  recent  injuries
had  been  avenged.  At  this  time  Florence  also  demolished
the  Castle  of  Plan  di  Mezzo  in  the  Val  d'Arno  and  razed
the  walls  of  Poggibonsi.

Meanwhile,  hovv'ever,  the  power  of  the  Angevins  had
swelled    to    a    formidable    extent.       Charles   was    firmly

established  on  the  Neapolitan  throne  ;  and  during  the
interregnum  had  been  nominated  by  the  Popes  senator  of
Rome  and  vicar-imperial  of  Romagna  as  well  as  Tuscany.
Accordingly,  while  restoring  the  strength  of  the  Guelph
party,  he  had  notably  aggrandised  his  own  authority.
His  lurking  ambition  to  be  master  of  all  Italy  was  now
clearly  discernible,  and  accordingly  the  Florentines  began
to  kick  against  his  perpetual  interference,  and  to  object
to  every  commune  being  subject  to  a  Podesta  of  his
choice  exercising  absolute  judicial  power  in  his  name
and  under  his  authority.  And  as  though  this  were  not
enough,  there  was  also  a  royal  marshal  or  vicar  in
Tuscany  who  jointly  with  the  rest  perpetually  harassed
the  city  by  threatening  demands  for  fresh  subsidies.  But
even  greater  than  elsewhere  was  the  jealousy  excited  in
Rome.  The  Popes  had  summoned  the  Angevins  to  the
overthrow  of  the  Suabians,  less  on  account  of  these  being
Ghibellines,  those  Guelphs,  than  because  the  Suabians  had
entertained  the  identical  ambition  that  Charles  was  now
beginning  to  conceive.  Accordingly,  there  was  now  the
same  motive  for  combating  him.

Niccolo  Machiavelli  has  often  repeated  that  the  Popes
"  always  feared  every  one  who  rose  to  great  power  in
Italy,  albeit  his  power  was  exercised  by  favour  of  the
Church.  And  inasmuch  as  they  [the  Popes]  sought  to
lower  that  power,  frequent  tumults  would  arise  and
frequent  changes  of  power,  since  fear  of  a  tyrant  led
to  the  exaltation  of  some  feebler  personage,  and  then,  as
his  power  became  increased,  he  in  turn  was  feared,  and,
being  feared,  his  overthrow  was  desired.  Thus,  the
government  taken  from  Manfred  was  conceded  to  Charles  ;
thus,  later,  when  he  excited  fear,  his  ruin  likewise  was
planned."  ^  In  fact,  Urban  IV.  had  invited  Charles  to
seize  the  kingdom  of  Naples  ;  Clement  IV.  had  named

CHANGE  OF  THE  PAPAL  POLICY.  253

him  his  vicar  ;  Gregory  X.  was  now  beginning  to  oppose
him,  and  succeeding  pontiffs  followed  his  example.  Thus
three  different  political  games  were  now  being  played  in
Central  Italy  :  the  Angevins  already  yearning  for  the
dominion  of  Italy  ;  the  Florentines  scheming  to  use  the
French  monarch's  power  to  assure  their  own  predominance
in  Tuscany ;  and  the  Popes  seeking  to  check  the  king's
ambition  and  resume  their  former  supremacy  over  that
state.

IV,

The  first  sign  of  this  alteration  in  the  Papal  policy  was
quickly  detected  by  Florence,  although  Rome  used  every
device  to  conceal  the  real  cause  and  object  of  the  change  ;
and,  indeed,  to  prevent  its  change  of  purpose  from  appear-
ing on  the  surface.  Gregory  X.  began  by  expressing  regret
that  a  city  so  rich  and  powerful  as  Florence  should  still
be  divided  by  the  party  strife  of  the  Guelphs  and  Ghibel-
lines.  He  desired  to  see  them  at  peace.  No  wish  should
have  seemed  more  natural  on  the  part  of  the  Head  of
the  Church  ;  but  it  roused  the  king's  suspicions  to  find
the  Pope  suddenly  inflamed  by  such  unusual  compassion
towards  the  Ghibellines.  His  distrust  was  heightened
on  seeing  how  cheerfully  the  Florentines  accepted  the
proposals  of  the  Pope.  They  had  already  shown  signs
of  wishing  to  shake  off  the  royal  yoke  by  requesting  the
king  to  give  them  an  Italian  Podesta,  as  their  statutes
required,   and    already    in    January,    1270,^    he    had    felt

obliged  to  make  this  concession  in  a  graciously  worded
decree.  Instantly  divining  the  real  intention  of  Rome,
the  Florentines  now  understood  that  the  moment  had
come  to  second  it  for  their  own  advantage.  They  were
all  the  more  willing  to  do  so  not  only  to  impose  a  check
on  the  growing  tyranny  of  the  king,  but  in  order  to
remedy  another  evil  wrought  by  his  supremacy  in
Florence.  Charles  was  always  surrounded  by  his  own
barons  and  captains,  whose  foreign  presence  was  unwel-
come, and  by  Gueiph  nobles  and  knights  not  only  ot
Tuscany,  bur  from  other  parts  of  Italy  as  well.  In
Florence  he  constantly  favoured  the  old  Gueiph  nobility,
and  on  every  visit  to  the  city  created  new  knights.  Thus,
ennobled  Gueiph  merchants  were  Joined  to  the  other
aristocrats,  and  assuming  the  rank  oi  grandly  soon  became
opposed  to  the  people,  and  revived  the  old  antipathy
of  the  Florentine  democrats,  who,  just  as  they  had
rebelled  in  past  times  against  the  feudal  pride  of  the
Ghibellines,  now  refused  to  tolerate  that  of  the  old  and
new  Gueiph  patriciate.  Therefore  it  was  necessary  to
curb  the  grandi  at  any  cost,  and  it  seemed  the  wisest
plan  to  recall  the  Ghibellines,  who  were  equally  opposed
to  them  and  the  king.  Thus  the  people  would  be
strengthened  by  the  division  of  the  nobles,  and  the  latter,
by  quarrelling  among  themselves,  would  lessen  the  number
of  those  most  subservient  to  Charles.  The  king,  however,
could  not  be  blind  to  the  hidden  purpose  of  these  intrigues,
and  was  quite  awake  to  the  Pope's  real  intentions.  He
knew  that  the  latter  was  now  urging  the  Germans  to  elect
Rudolf  of  Hapsburg  as  King  of  the  Romans,  in  order  to

GREGORY  X.  IN  FLORENCE.  255

put  an  end  to  the  Imperial  interregnum,  and  consequentlv
to  his  own  tenure  of  the  vicariate.  Why  should  the  Pope
desire  the  election  of  an  emperor  save  for  the  purpose  of
weakening  the  Angevin  power  ?  Meanwhile  both  pon
tiff  and  king  preserved  a  feint  of  amity,  and  seemed  tc
be  on  the  best  possible  terms,  although  their  mutual  dis-
trust continually  flashed  forth.

Gregory  X.  had  decreed  the  convocation  of  a  Council
at  Lyons  in  1274  in  order  to  promote  a  crusade  against
the  infidels;  and  reaching  Florence  on  June  18,  1273,
suspended  his  journey  for  awhile  for  the  purpose,  as  he
said,  of  re-establishing  the  general  peace.  He  arrived
with  his  whole  train  of  cardinals  and  prelates,  accompanied
by  the  Emperor  of  Byzantium,  Baldwin  11. ,  who  came  to
ask  Christian  aid  against  the  Infidel,  and  escorted  by
Charles  of  Anjou,  whose  sense  of  the  honour  due  to  the
pontiff,  so  he  said,  forbade  leaving  him  alone  in  Florence.
And  as  the  Pope  found  the  city  to  his  liking,  he  decided
to  spend  the  whole  summer  there.  The  2nd  of  July  was
the  day  fixed  for  the  solemn  reconciliation  of  the  Guelphs
and  Ghibellines,  and  the  syndics,  or  leaders,  of  either
party  were  gathered  in  the  town.  On  the  waste  of  dry
sand  in  the  bed  of  the  Arno  by  the  Ponte  alle  Grazie
wooden  platforms  had  been  erected,  and  here  the  Pope,
the  Emperor  Baldwin,  and  Charles  of  Anjou  were  seated
in  state.  The  oath  of  peace  was  sworn  in  the  presence  of
a  great  throng  of  spectators  ;  the  syndics  exchanged
kisses,  and  the  Pope  gave  his  benediction,  threatening
excommunication  on  all  who  should  dare  to  break  the
peace.  Both  sides  gave  hostages  and  yielded  castles  as
pledges  of  faith,  and  everything  seemed  to  be  arranged  in
accordance  with  the  benevolent  intentions  of  the  Pope.
The  Holy  Father  was  lodged  in  the  palace  of  his  bankers,
the  Mozzi,  Baldwin  in  that  of  the  bishop,  while  Charles
occupied    several    houses    in    the    Frescobaldi    gardens.


256        THE  DOMINANT  POWER  IN  TUSCANY.

There  was  now  time  to  enjoy  life  in  Florence  before  the
return  of  the  banished  Ghibellines  and  the  festivals  to  be
given  in  their  honour.  But  suddenly  it  was  learnt  that
the  Ghibelline  syndics,  instead  of  carrying  out  the  con-
cluding terms  of  the  peace,  had  hastily  fled  from  Florence.
And  the  reason  alleged  for  this  was,  that  the  king's
vicar  had  sent  them  an  intimation  that  unless  they  left
the  city  without  delay,  he  would  harve  them  all  cut  to
pieces  at  the  request  of  the  Guelph  nobles.  Thereupon
the  Pope  instantly  set  out  for  the  Mugello,  much  enraged
not  only  with  the  king,  but  even  more  with  the
Florentines  for  their  indifference  to  the  whole  farce,  and
he  punished  their  violation  of  the  oath  by  pronouncing  an
interdict  on  the  city.

Meanwhile  Charles  continued  his  aggressive  policy  with
regard  to  the  Ghibellines,  and  was  seconded  by  the  Floren-
tines, who  marched  out  under  the  banner  of  the  Commune,
sometimes  alone,  but  oftener  in  junction  with  the  French
cavalry,  to  impose  peace  and  assure  the  triumph  of  their
party  in  all  the  neighbouring  towns.  But  their  arrogant
daring  was  sometimes  pushed  too  far.  When  the  Ghibel-
lines were  expelled  from  Bologna,  the  Florentines  im-
mediately set  out  to  proffer  their  unrequested  aid  to  that
city.  But,  much  to  their  amazement,  on  reaching  the
banks  of  the  Reno,  they  found  the  Bolognese  waiting  to
drive  them  back.  The  latter  had  achieved  their  purpose
of  banishing  the  Ghibellines,  but  had  no  intention  ot
allowing  the  haughty  Florentines  to  come  to  disseminate
their  own  party  rancours  under  pretence  of  assisting  the
city.  The  Podesta  of  the  Florentines  was  killed  in  trying
to  push  through  the  opposing  force,  and  the  humiliated
expedition  had  to  retrace  its  steps  (1274).

They  were  more  fortunate  with  regard  to  Pisa.  That
city,  being  torn  by  party  strife,  had  banished  Giovanni
Visconti,  judge    of  Gallura,    and    Count    Ugolino    della


COUNT  UGOLINO  RECALLED  TO  PISA.        257

Gherardesca  di  Donoratico,  two  ambitious  Ghibelline
nobles,  who,  deserting  their  own  for  the  Guelph  cause,
applied  to  the  Florentines  for  help.  They  immediately
granted  it,  and  joining  forces  with  their  new  friends  and
the  French,  invaded  the  territories  of  their  old  rival,
capturing  the  Castle  of  Asciano  in  September,  1275.  The
following  June,  at  the  instigation  of  the  same  exiled
nobles,  they  resumed  hostilities  with  a  larger  army,  aided
by  the  Lucchese  and  other  Guelphs,  and  accompanied  by
the  king's  marshal.  Again  victorious,  they  compelled  Pisa
to  make  peace  on  June  13,  1276,  and  recall  her  exiles,
especially  the  Count  Ugolino,  whose  ambition  was
destined  to  bring  fatal  consequences  on  himself  and  his
native  town.

Meanwhile  Pope  Gregory  had  returned  from  Lyons
and  reached  Tuscany  in  December,  1275.  Still  highly
irritated  against  Florence,  he  refused  to  enter  its  gates  ;
but  as  the  Arno  was  too  swollen  to  be  fordable,  he  was
obliged  to  cross  one  of  its  bridges,  and  therefore  raised
the  interdict  from  the  city,  although  only  during  the  time
required  for  his  passage.  His  death  took  place  shortly
afterwards,  January  10,  1276,  and  in  a  single  year  three
new  Popes  rapidly  succeeded  him  :  Innocent  V.,  Adrian  V.,
and  John  XXI.  Then,  on  November  25,  1277,  Nicholas
III.  was  elected  to  the  pontifical  Chair,  and  during  his
three  years'  reign  followed  the  same  policy  pursued  by
Gregory  X.,  and  with  even  greater  zeal.  Full  of
haughtiness  and  ambition,  Nicholas  sought  to  aggrandise
his  own  family  as  well  as  the  Papal  power.  He  renewed
the  scandalous  practice  of  nepotism  and  simony  by  making
some  of  his  kinsmen  cardinals  and  appointing  others  to
high  offices  of  the  State.  But  on  trying  to  negotiate  the
marriage  of  one  of  his  nieces  with  a  nephew  of  King
Charles,  the  latter  mortally  wounded  his  pride  by  the
reply,  that  although  the  Pope  had  crimson  hose,  his  blood

had  not  been  sufficiently  ennobled  to  be  mixed  with  that
of  French  royalty.^  Nicholas  III.,  already  disgusted  with
the  king,  and  suspicious  of  his  motives,  could  not  easily
pardon  this  affront.  Hence  he  seized  the  first  opportunity
to  let  Charles  know  that  although  Rudolf  of  Hapsburg
had  not  yet  been  crowned  emperor  in  Rome,  he  had  been
already  elected  king  of  the  Romans  in  Germany,  and  that
accordingly  it  was  no  longer  needful  for  Charles  to  fill  the
post  of  vicar-imperial,  only  granted  him  during  the
interregnum.  Thus  the  French  monarch  was  finally  com-
pelled to  resign  the  vicariate  of  Tuscany,  the  title  of  Roman
Senator,  and  even  his  jurisdiction  over  Romagna  and  the
Marches,  that  had  been  partly  accorded  to,  partly  usurped
by  him.  Perceiving  that  there  was  no  possibility  of
evading  this  blow,  the  king  instantly  yielded  the  point
without  showing  the  slightest  resentment,  so  that  the
Pope  was  driven  to  declare  :  "  This  prince  may  have  in-
herited his  fortune  from  the  House  of  France,  his  cunning
from  Spain,  but  his  shrewdness  of  address  could  only
have  been  acquired  by  frequenting  the  Court  of  Rome."  2
Nevertheless,  he  was  not  in  the  least  deceived  by  the
king's  apparent  calmness,  and  neglected  no  chance  of
diminishing  his  power  and  aggrandising  that  of  the  Holy
See.  Thus,  when  Giovanni  da  Procida  was  going
through  Italy  seeking  help  for  the  Sicilian  revolution
that  was  soon  to  burst  forth,  he  received  encouragement
from  the  Pope.  Then,  after  showing  much  favour  to
Rudolph  of  Hapsburg,  Nicholas  profited  by  the  occasion
to  obtain  his  sanction  for  extending  the  states  of  the
Church  as  far  as  the  Neapolitan  frontier  on  one  side,  and
for  including  the  March  of  Ancona,  Romagna  and  the
Pentapolis  on  the  other.  And  down  to  our  own  day
the    states    of    the    Church    preserved    these    boundaries

almost  unaltered.  Although  at  the  time,  the  domina-
tion of  the  Popes  was  chiefly  nominal  over  part  of  this
territory,  yet  by  dint  of  insistence  they  gradually  achieved
practical  supremacy  over  the  whole  of  it.


V.

As  a  first  step  in  this  direction,  Nicholas  III.  sent  his
nephew,  Cardinal  Latino  de'  Frangipani,  to  establish  peace
in  Romagna.  As  a  Dominican  monk,  Frangipani  had
shown  great  powers  of  oratory,  and  was  therefore  fitted
to  enforce  the  new  authority  of  the  Church.  Count
Bertoldo  Orsini  was  also  sent  with  him.  After  a  short
stay  in  Romagna,  the  cardinal  was  transferred  to  Florence
to  renew  with  better  success  the  reconciliation  of  hostile
parties  Gregory  X.  had  failed  to  conclude.  Now,  how-
ever, the  Florentines  themselves  seemed  really  desirous  of
peace.  Although  freed  from  the  too  oppressive  protection
of  King  Charles,  they  still  suffered  from  the  evil  results  of
his  policy.  The  grandly  turbulent  as  ever,  and  with  increased
numbers  and  strength,  were  threatening  division  even
among  the  Guelphs.  Villani  says  of  them  that,  "  Resting
from  victories  and  honours  won  in  wars  abroad,  and
fattening  on  the  lands  of  exiled  Ghibellines  and  other
fruits  of  enterprise,  they  began  from  pride  and  envy  to
fall  out  with  one  another ;  so  that  many  quarrels  and
feuds  arose  among  the  citizens  of  Florence,  and  much
killing  and  wounding."  ^  First  the  Adimari  began  to  stir
riots  from  hatred  against  the  Tosinghi,  next  the  Pazzi
and  Donati  came  to  blows ;  and  this  was  seen  to  be  a
prelude  to  greater  evils.  Accordingly  the  Guelphs  sent
messengers  to  the  Pope,  praying  him  to  send  some  one
to    pacify   the   city,   unless    he   wished   to   see   the   party


'  Villani,  vii.  56.


26o        THE  DOMINANT  POWER  IN  TUSCANY.

divided  against  itself.  The  Ghibellines  seemed  equally
mxious  for  peace.  They  were  weary  of  prolonged  exile
,md  continual  confiscation  of  their  property,  and  cherished
hopes  that  the  popular  hatred,  being  now  inflamed  against
the  Guelph  nobles,  would  be  softened  towards  themselves.'^

Accordingly  Cardinal  Latino  entered  Florence  on
October  8,  1279,  with  three  hundred  knights  and  prelates
in  his  train,  and  was  received  with  every  token  of  honour.
The  Florentine  clergy  went  to  meet  him  in  procession,
and  the  Republic  sent  forth  the  Carroccio  with  a  great
number  of  standard-bearers.  Being  a  Dominican,  he  was
lodged  in  the  monastery  of  Santa  Maria  Novella,  and  laid
the  first  stone  of  the  celebrated  church  of  that  name.
He  immediately  began  the  negotiations  for  the  arrange-
ment of  peace.

On  the  1 9th  of  November  platforms  were  raised  in  the
Piazza  of  Santa  Maria  Novella  Vecchia,  and  the  parliament
being  assembled  there  in  the  presence  of  the  magistrates
and  councils,  the  cardinal  asked  and  obtained  the  power
of  concluding  peace  with  the  same  authority  possessed  by
the  people — that  is  to  say,  the  right  of  imposing  fines,
decreeing  confiscations,  and  occupying  castles,  to  guarantee
the  due  performance  of  the  terms  about  to  be  sworn.
He  next  essayed  to  reconcile  the  bitterest  foes  :  Guelphs
who  had  come  to  a  rupture,  quarrelsome  Ghibellines,  and
hostile  Guelphs  and  Ghibellines.  All  went  well  until  he
came  to  the  Buondelmonti  and  Uberti,  whose  ancient  hatred
was  too  deeply  rooted.  It  was  impossible  to  persuade  them
to  be  reconciled,  for  some  of  them  indignantly  rejected
the  proposal.  Hence  the  Cardinal  had  to  decree  their
excommunication,  and  banish  the  more  obstinate  from  the
Commune.  Finally,  January  18,  1280,  was  fixed  for  the
conclusion  of  the  general  peace.  Great  preparations  for
the  ceremony  were  made  in  the  Piazza  of  Santa  Maria

ptyled  Captain  of  the  mass  of  the  Guelph  party),  and  their
;:ouncils,  together  with  all  the  rest  of  the  magistrates,  and
\  1  great  concourse  of  spectators.  Lastly  came  the  cardinal
with  his  attendant  prelates,  and  the  general  excitement  was
heightened  by  the  expectation  of  his  speech,  since  he  was
inown  to  be  one  of  the  most  eloquent  orators  of  his  time.
He  gave  an  address  on  the  merit  and  necessity  of  making
Deace,  and  finally  the  treaty  was  read  aloud.  It  was  to
3ut  an  end  to  all  the  old  hatreds  ;  it  stipulated  the  restitu-
:ion  of  confiscated  property  to  the  Ghibellines,  with  some
nterest  on  the  capital ;  all  sentences,  oaths,  leagues,  and
issociations  made  by  the  one  party  to  the  hurt  of  the  other
vere  declared  null  and  void,  and  every  clause  of  the
;tatutes  tending  to  the  perpetuation  of  strife  was  to  be
■jancelled.  Either  party  was  to  furnish  fifty  sureties,  and
)ound  to  forfeit  the  sum  of  fifty  thousand  silver  marks,
n  case  of  any  violation  of  the  peace.  As  an  additional
?;uarantee  certain  castles  were  to  be  given  up,  and  the  right
vas  reserved  of  demanding  more  hostages  should  occasion
equire.  Then  came  a  long  string  of  minute  stipulations,
ill  directed  to  the  same  end.  Many  of  the  chief  families
vere  to  be  confined  to  fixed  places  until  they  made  peace
vith  their  foes  and  gave  money  and  hostages  in  pledge  of
!;ood  faith.  The  delegates  of  both  parties  kissed  one
nother  on  the  mouth,  the  documents  of  the  treaty  were
olemnly  registered,  and  party  decrees  of  banishment  and
)ther  sentences  cancelled  or  burnt.  The  exiles  were
.uthorised  to  return  ;  and,  without  prejudice  to  the  func-
ions  of  the  Podesta,  the  captains,  and  guild-masters,
vere  charged  with  the  strict  maintenance  of  the  terms  of
)eace.  For  this  reason  the  Captain  was  no  longer  to

the  city  and  conservator  of  peace.  Also,  the  office  of
vicar-imperial  granted  to  Charles  having  now  lapsed,  it
was  decreed  that  henceforward  the  Podesta  and  Captain
were  to  be  nominated  for  two  years  by  the  Pope,  and  have
each  the  command  of  fifty  horse  and  fifty  foot  soldiers.
After  two  years  the  right  of  election  would  be  resumed
by  the  people,  provided  their  nominees  were  not  opposed
to,  but  actually  approved  by,  the  Head  of  the  Church.
Each  Captain  would  then  have  the  command  of  one
hundred  horse  and  one  hundred  foot,  but,  for  the  better
preservation  of  peace,  the  said  troops  must  neither  be
citizens  nor  natives  of  the  territory.  The  guilds  were
likewise  sworn  to  assist  in  maintaining  peace.  It  was
farther  decreed  that  the  statutes  should  be  revised,  the
government  of  the  city  reformed,  and  an  estimate  made
of  the  property  of  all  persons  who  had  been  condemned
to  pay  fines  or  damages.^

This  would  seem  to  show  that  the  cardinal  was  almost
in  the  position  of  a  provisional  dictator,  with  arbitrary
power  of  decision.  But  he  first  consulted  the  magistrates
as  to  many  clauses  proposed  by  him,  while  regarding  other
conditions  of  the  agreement  the  Florentines  obeyed  them
or  not  as  they  chose.  The  people  desired  peace  for  the
reasons  we  have  already  described  and  the  cardinal  was
therefore  given  full  powers  to  conclude  it  on  his  own
authority  and  that  of  the  Church.  But  his  success  was  far
more  apparent  than  real.     In  fact,  the  constitution  of  the

'  Ammirato  the  younger  was  the  first  writer  to  give  an  exact  report  ot
this  agreement,  with  minute  details  derived  from  State  papers,  in  bis
additions  to  the  elder  Ammirato's  "History"  (Anno  1279  and  1280).
Several  documents  are  given  in  the  "  Delizie  degli  Eruditi  Toscani,"
by  Padre  Ildefonso,  vol.  ix.  p.  63  and  fol.  Still  ampler  details  are  given
by  Bonaini  ("  Delia  Parte  Guelfa  in  Firenze ")  in  the  Giornale  Storico
degli  Archivi  Toscani,  vol.  iii.  p.  167  and  fol.  Vide  also  A.  Gherardi's
recent  and  very  important  work,  "  Le  Consulte  della  Repubblica  Fioren-
tina"  (Firenze,  Sansoni).  The  original  document  of  the  Peace  is  to  be
found  (mutilated)  in  the  State  Archives  of  Florence.


CONSTITUTIONAL  REFORMS,  263

Guelph  party  remained  in  force,  and  as  soon  as  he  had
gone,  the  city  was  again  torn  by  faction  strife.  He  left
Florence  on  April  24,  1280,  after  receiving  a  recompense
of  "  mille  floreni  auri  in  pecunia  numerata,  et  alie  zoie
empte  pro  Comuni  Florentie."

Nevertheless,  during  February  and  the  beginning  of
March,  he  was  so  satisfied  with  his  imagined  success  as  to
attempt  the  reconciliation  of  many  adversaries  confined  to
fixed  domiciles.  He  likewise  tried  to  give  effect  to  the
constitutional  reforms  prescribed  by  the  peace ;  above
all,  that  of  replacing  the  twelve  worthies  by  fourteen
"  good  men,"  composed  of  eight  Guelphs  and  six  Ghibel-
lines.  These  functionaries,  in  co-operation  with  the
Captains  and  the  councils,  formed  the  government  of  the
city,  and  were  changed  every  second  month.  Neverthe-
less, the  Podesta  and  Captain  remained  in  office  for  one
year  more.  The  authority  of  the  Podesta,  as  the  nominee
of  King  Charles,  had  been  much  diminished  under  the
latter's  rule  ;  accordingly  increased  powers  were  now
conferred  on  the  Captain  and  Twelve,  and  the  latter
being  augmented  to  fourteen,  ^  constituted  the  supreme
power  or  Signory  of  Florence.

This  custom  of  changing  the  Signory  every  second
month — a  custom  maintained  to  the  close  of  che  Republic
— has  given  rise  to  much  discussion.  Certainly,  this  rapid
mutation  of  the  highest  power  in  the  State  could  not
be  favourable  to  peace ;  but,  as  we  have  had  frequent
occasion  to  note,  the  new  constitution  of  the  guilds  had
reduced  the  attributes  of  the  central  government  to  a
minimum.     Besides,  the  manifest  tendency  of  all  Italian

'  The  Fourteen  are  mentioned  together  with  the  Twelve  in  the
cardinal's  treaty  of  peace,  and  for  some  time  later  both  bodies  are
simultaneously  mentioned  in  the  "  Consulte,"  according  to  the  usual
Florentine  custom  of  enumerating  the  old  as  well  as  the  new  magis-
trates. Subsequently  the  Fourteen  alone  are  recorded,  and  the  Twelve
disappear  entirely.

republics  to  degenerate  into  despotism  made  the  Floren-
tines distrustfiil  of  any  Signory  of  longer  duration.  Now,
too,  the  Ghibellines  having  returned,  there  was  special
cause  to  fear  that  the  government  might  be  induced  to
conspire  in  favour  of  some  ambitious  personage  disposed
to  play  the  tyrant  at  a  moment's  notice.  For  these
reasons,  it  was  decided  on  the  one  hand  to  lessen  the
authority  of  the  Podesta,  and  on  the  other  to  frequently
change  not  only  the  heads  of  the  government,  but  even,
as  will  be  seen,  other  political  functionaries  as  well.
Later  on,  election  by  ballot  was  adopted  as  another
means  of  preventing  the  carrying  out  of  any  pre-
arranged design  against  freedom.^


VI.

Meanwhile  the  King  of  the  Romans  was  sending  his
vicar  to  Italy,  with  an  escort  of  three  hundred  men  only,  to
ascertain  the  temper  of  the  land,  and  whether  the  cities  still
acknowledged  the  suzerainty  of  the  Empire.  On  arriving
in  Tuscany,  the  vicar  made  halt  at  San  Miniato  al  Tedesco,
and  found  the  Pisans  still  Ghibellines,  and  eager  to  swear
fealty.  But  when  the  other  Tuscan  cities  refused  to  recog-
nise the  rights  of  the  Empire  the  Florentines  corrupted
the  vicar  with  bribes,  and,  showing  him  the  futility  of
his  mission,  persuaded  him  to  depart  acknowledging  the
force  of  the  privileges  granted  them  by  the  Pope.

Thus  they  dexterously  contrived  to  make  the  altered
policy  of  Rome  a  means  of  advancing  their  own  interests
and  damaging  those  of  King  Charles,  whose  power  over
Central  Italy  was  entirely  lost.  By  once  more  calling
the  Empire  to   the  front,  and  encouraging  Rudolph  of

xCING  SECURES  ELECTION  OF  FRENCH  POPE.  265

Hapsburg  to  assert  himself  against  Charles,  Nicholas  III.
succeeded  in  weakening  both,  while  giving  new  strength
to  the  Papacy.  So,  too,  with  equal  sagacity,  the  Floren-
tines had  made  use  of  the  king  to  dominate  Tuscany  ;  of
the  Pope  to  enfeeble  the  king  ;  and,  finally,  of  both  to
avoid  yielding  submission  to  Rudolph.

Nicholas  III.  died  in  1280.  He  had  compelled  Charles
to  leave  Tuscany,  and  be  satisfied  with  receiving  from
Rudolph  the  investiture  of  Provence  and  the  kingdom  of
Naples.  To  render  this  agreement  more  binding,  by
means  of  a  family  alliance,  Rudolph  gave  his  daughter
in  marriage  to  a  grandson  of  King  Charles.  But  naturally
the  latter  accepted  the  arrangement  most  reluctantly,  and
took,  every  opportunity  of  secretly  exciting  the  I'uscan
Guelphs  against  the  Ghibellines,  who  were  again  coming
to  the  front.  Also,  having  learnt  by  his  own  experience
the  serious  difference  between  having  the  Popes  as  friends
or  as  foes,  he  hastened  to  Orvieto,  where  the  new  conclave
was  sitting,  determined  to  use  every  means  to  procure  the
election  of  some  candidate  favouring  his  views.  As  usual,
he  pursued  this  purpose  unhesitatingly  and  without  scruple.
Perceiving  that  the  cardinals  were  temporising,  and
dreading  the  consequences  of  delay,  he  excited  a  revolt,
during  which  the  populace  captured  two  cardinals  of  the
Orsini  house,  relations  of  the  deceased  Pope,  and  decidedly
opposed  to  the  Angevin  interests.  After  this  event  the
election  took  place,  and  on  February  22,  1281,  Martin  IV.
was  proclaimed.  The  new  pontiff  was  French,  and  being
very  friendly  to  Charles,  immediately  undertook  to  forward
his  policy  and  support  the  Guelphs.

But  the  general  conditions  of  Italy  were  much  changed,
and  therefore  the  king's  triumph  at  Orvieto  failed  to  pre-
vent the  consequences  entailed  by  his  cruelty  in  Naples,
and  by  the  policy  of  Nicholas  III.  from  producing  their
natural  effect.     The  latter's  agreement  with  Rudolph  was


266        THE  DOMINANT  POWER  IN  TUSCANY.

ratified  by  the  new  Pope,  who  counselled  the  cities  of  Italy
to  accord  a  hearty  welcome  to  the  emperor's  daughter,
when  she  came  as  the  bride  of  the  king's  nephew.  Even
Florence  was  obliged  to  give  the  princess  an  honourable
reception,  although  she  was  accompanied  by  an  Imperial
vicar,  who,  as  usual,  abode  at  San  Miniato,  in  order  to
attempt  to  resuscitate  the  rights  of  the  Empire  in  Tuscany.
But  a  far  graver  change  occurred  in  March,  1282,  when
the  Sicilians,  wearied  of  misgovernment,  at  last  snatched
up  the  gauntlet  thrown  by  Conradin  to  the  people,  and
with  the  sanguinary  revolt  of  the  Vespers  began  the  long
and  glorious  war  that  was  to  free  Sicily  for  ever  from  the
Angevin  yoke.  In  order  to  keep  faith  with  the  Guelph
party  and  avoid  unnecessarily  irritating  the  Pope  or  the
king,  the  Florentines  sent  five  hundred  horse  to  the  latter's
aid  ;  and  this  contingent,  commanded  by  Count  Guido  di
Battifolle  of  the  Guidi  house,  and  bearing  the  banner  of
Florence,  took  part  in  the  siege  of  Messina.  But  the
revolution  was  everywhere  triumphant;  the  Florentines
shared  in  the  general  defeat,  and  had  to  return,  leaving
their  flag  in  the  enemy's  hands.  The  island  was  inevit-
ably lost  to  the  French.

Even  before  the  outbreak  of  the  Sicilian  Vespers  the
Florentines  had  naturally  begun  to  be  on  the  alert  and
watchful  of  their  own  interests.  Noting  that  the  vicar
was  only  attended  by  a  small  force,  and  gained  few
adherents,  they  soon  tried  to  win  him  with  gold,  and
succeeded  in  persuading  him  to  leave  the  country  after
confirming  the  concessions  previously  granted  to  them.
At  the  same  time,  profiting  by  the  emperor's  weakness  in
consequence  of  troubles  at  home,  and  by  the  fact  of
Charles  being  at  a  distance  in  Naples  and  already  gravely
preoccupied  concerning  the  approaching  crisis  in  Sicily,
they  seized  the  opportunity  to  make  some  constitutional
reforms.     First  of  all,  now  that  the  Podesta  and  Captain


EFFORTS  TO  CHECK  ARROGANCE  OF  NOBLES.  267

were  no  longer  elected  by  the  king,  but  named  instead  by
the  Pope,  they  decided  to  grant  them  ampler  powers,  in
order  to  keep  the  city  quiet  by  checking  the  arrogance  of
the  GhibelHnes  and  tyranny  of  the  grandi.  Both  factions
were  daily  becoming  more  threatening  ;  and  particularly
the  latter,  which  cancelled  magisterial  decrees  by  absolute
force,  prevented  the  laws  from  being  executed,  committed
murder  either  directly  or  indirectly  for  the  sake  of  party
revenge,  and  kept  the  city  in  a  perpetual  turmoil.  It  was
therefore  decreed  to  allow  the  Podesta  greater  freedom  of
action  in  the  general  repression  of  crime,  and  give  the
Captain  a  larger  force  with  which  to  maintain  order  and
punish  criminals  to  whom  the  Podesta  might  have  been
too  lenient.  The  grandi  were  not  only  bound  to  swear
obedience  to  the  laws,  but  to  give  hostages  for  their  good
faith ;  so  that  even  should  they  succeed  in  escaping  from
the  city  after  committing  any  crime,  those  who  had  given
surety,  or  stood  hostage  for  them,  would  have  to  suffer  in
their  stead  all  punishments  or  fines  to  which  the  contuma-
cious were  condemned.  To  ensure  the  execution  of  all
these  decrees  a  thousand  armed  men  were  chosen  among
the  citizens.  Of  this  number  two  hundred  were  con-
tributed by  the  Sesto  of  St,  Piero  Scheraggio,  as  many  by
that  of  the  Borgo,  the  four  other  Sesti  each  giving  150
men,  and  then  the  whole  thousand  being  divided  in  com-
panies with  the  banners  of  the  different  quarters,  or  rather
sestieri  of  the  city,  450  men  were  placed  at  the  orders
of  the  Podesta,  and  550  under  the  Captain's  command.
They  bore  colours  given  them  by  either  magistrate  in  the
presence  of  the  public  parliament,  and  whenever  the  bell
rang  the  signal  for  their  assembly  no  gatherings  of  the
people  were  allowed  in  the  city.^

'  The  old  chronicles  contain  indications  of  these  particulars,  but  for
the  minute  description  of  them,  corroborated  by  documentary  evidence,
vide  Ammirato  the  younger,  in  his  appendices  to  the  "  Storie "  of
Ammirato  the  elder.


268         THE  DOMINANT  POWER  IN  TUSCANY.

This  reform  seemed  the  more  indispensable,  seeing  that
under  Charles's  rule  the  employment  of  citizen  soldiers
commanded  by  the  gonfaloniers  of  the  guilds  had  fallen
into  disuse,  and  order  was  maintained  by  means  of  foreign
troops.      Thus   the  Captain   had  forfeited  much  of  the
authority  that    it   was   now  sought   to    restore   to    him.
Now,  too,  we  find  the  Fourteen  empowered  to  conduct
the  government  without  summoning  the  Council  of  One
Hundred,  of  which  the  documents  cease  to  make  mention.
Owing  to  this,  and  also  to  the  lack  of  concord  between
the  eight  Guelph  and  six  Ghibelline  members,  the  autho-
rity of  the  Fourteen,  instead  of  being  strengthened,  suffered
decline.     Accordingly,    another  reform  was  in  course  of
arrangement,  when  the  outbreak  of  the  Sicilian  Vespers
gave  the  Florentines  more  freedom  of  action.     They  had
three    special    objects    in    view.       Firstly,    to    make    the
Republic    independent    of    Pope,    emperor    and    king  ;
secondly,  to  close  accounts  with  the  Ghibellines,  because
they  were  nobles,  and  as  constant  adherents  to  the  Empire
supported  its  pretensions  in  Tuscany  ;  thirdly,  to  lower
the  pride  of  the  grandly  whether  Guelphs  or  Ghibellines,
because  their  tyrannous  deeds  kept  the  city  in  continual
disturbance.     This,  indeed,  was  one  reason  why  the  terms
of  Cardinal  Latino's  peace  were  no  longer  observed  ;  and
why,    above    all,    the    promised   indemnities   to    injured
Ghibellines  had  never  been  paid.     Also,  on  February  8,
1282,  a   Guelphic    League  was    concluded   with    Lucca,
Pistoia,  Prato,  Volterra,  and  Sienna,  whose  adherence  was
compulsory  ;  and  San  Gimignano,  Colle,  and  Poggibonsi
were  also  given  permission  to  join.      The  members  of  the
League  swore  to  remain  united  ten  years  for  the  common
defence,  and  were  each  pledged  to  hire  five  hundred  horse
with  the  customary  number  of  squires.     Also,  as  usual,
the  allies  joined  in  a  species  of  convention  touching  the
exchange  and  passage  of  merchandise.


INTERNAL  REFORMS.  269

But  the  most  important  point  for  Florence  was  the
internal  reform  of  the  city.  All  the  guilds,  and  especially
some  of  greater,  were  becoming  more  strongly  organised,
and  acquiring  increased  political  influence.  In  fact,  the
capitudiniy  or  guild-masters,  figure  more  frequently  in  the
public  records,  side  by  side  with  the  Fourteen,  the  Captain,
and  Podesta.  It  is  at  this  period  (1282-3)  that  we  even
find  mendoned  a  Defensor  Artificum  et  Artium^  together
with  two  councils,  an  indubitable  sign  of  the  growing
power  of  the  guilds,  i  For,  although  the  Defensor  dis-
appears later  on,  and  his  office  is  deputed  to  the  Captain,
this  change  only  occurred  when  the  government  of  the
Republic  was  actually  carried  on  by  the  guilds.  Mean-
while they  already  shared  in  the  election  of  the  Fourteen,
and  aided  them  with  their  advice.  The  chroniclers  tell
us  that  by  a  reform  enacted  in  June,  1282,  the  priors  of
the  guilds  were  finally  raised  to  office  in  place  of  the
Fourteen  ;  but  in  fact  the  change  happened  less  suddenly
than  might  be  inferred  from  their  account  of  the  matter.
For  we  find  that — as  was  always  the  case  with  Florentine
reforms — the  Fourteen  continued  to  govern  in  co-operation
with  the  new  priors,  until,  overshadowed  by  the  growing
importance  of  the  latter,  they  gradually  disappeared
altogether.  It  is  certain  that  on  June  15,  1282,  three
Triors  of  the  Arts  were  made  chiefs  of  the  Republic —
namely,  the  priors  of  the  Calimala,  Money  Changers,  and
Woollen  Guilds.  They  were  attended  by  six  guards
(krrovieri),  and  had  six  heralds  to  summon  the  citizens
to  council  ;  they  dwelt  in  the  Badia,  without  leaving  it
during  their  whole  term  of  office,  and  generally  deliberated
in  junction  with  the  captain.     The  Fourteen  remained  in

'  Dr.  Hartwig,  who  first  called  attention  to  this  point,  also  remarked
that  the  office  of  Defensor  is  first  recorded  in  the  "Consulte,"  in  November,
1282,  and  that  the  first  Defender  mentioned  by  name  is  Bernardino  della
Porta.  "  Consulte,"  pp.  116,132,  133,  140,  from  November  6,  1282  to
February  6,  1283.

office  with  them  for  some  time  longer,  but  chiefly  pro
forma. ^  After  the  first  two  months  it  was  deemed
necessary  to  increase  the  number  of  the  priors,  not  only
because  three  were  found  to  be  insufficient  ;  but  also  being
necessarily  chosen  from  one  or  the  other  half  of  the  six
sestieri,  they  invariably  seemed  to  represent  one  division
only  of  the  citizens.  Accordingly,  to  avoid  delay,
in  the  August  of  the  same  year,  the  three  guilds  of
Doctors  and  Druggists,  Silkweavers  and  Mercers,  Skinners
and  Furriers,  were  added  to  the  original  number.  Other
guilds  also  were  subsequently  added,  but  the  number  of
the  priors  remained  restricted  to  six,  one  for  each  sestiere.
Compagni  says  that  "  their  laws  [or  functions]  consisted
in  guarding  the  property  of  the  Commune,  and  in  seeing
that  the  signories  did  justice  to  every  one,  and  that  petty
and  feeble  folk  were  not  oppressed  by  the  great  and
powerful."  2  At  the  end  of  their  two  months'  term  the
priors,  assisted  by  the  guild-masters  and  a  few  additional
citizens,  designated  as  arroti^  elected  their  own  successors
to  office.

Villani  affirms  that  the  title  of  prior  was  derived  from
a  verse  of  the  Gospel,  where  Christ  says  to  His  disciples,
"  Vos  estis  priores."  What  is  certain  is  that  by  means  of
this  reform  the  guilds,  or  rather  commerce  and  trade,  had
the  whole  government  of  the  Republic  in  their  hands  ;
and  it  should  also  be  noted  that  although  the  above-
mentioned  guilds,  together  with  that  of  the  jurists  and
notaries,  constituted  the  seven  greater  arts,  yet  the  legal
guild — perhaps  because  it  represented  neither  industry
nor    commerce — is  left  unnoticed  by    the  chroniclers    at

'  Dr.  Hartwig  also  ascertained  that  in  the  "  Consulte  "  the  first  mention
of  the  priors  occurs  on  June  26,  1282.  Their  names  are  recorded  after
those  of  the  Fourteen ;  on  April  24,  1283,  they  are  given  precedence  over
the  latter  ;  and  from  December  forwards  they  are  mentioned  alone,  with-
out the  Fourteen.

THE  GUILDS— RULERS  OF  THE  STATE.        271

this  point.  Henceforward  the  Commonwealth  is  a  true
republic  of  traders,  and  only  to  be  governed  by  members
of  the  guilds.  Every  title  of  nobility,  whether  old  or
new,  becomes  an  impediment  rather  than  a  privilege.

Consequently  many  of  the  principal  families  began  to
change  their  names  in  order  to  disguise  their  former  rank.
The  Tornaquinci  divided  into  Popoleschi,  Tornabuoni,
Giachinotti,  &c.  ;  the  Cavalcanti  became  Malatesti  and
Ciampoli ;  and  others  assumed  fresh  names.  ^  Nevertheless,
many  proudly  clung  to  their  ancient  appellations  and  titles ;
and  when  King  Charles'  son,  the  Prince  of  Salerno,  was
summoned  to  Naples  from  Provence,  he  halted  in  Florence
by  the  way  on  purpose  to  imitate  his  father  by  creating
new  knights.  By  these  artificial  devices  it  was  hoped  to
give  new  strength  to  an  aristocracy  that  was  doomed  to
decline  by  the  natural  course  of  events  ;  but  the  means
employed  were  too  utterly  opposed  to  the  political  and
social  temper  of  Florence  to  have  the  slightest  success
there.  No  longer  fettered  by  Pope  and  emperor,  and
emancipated  from  the  oppressive  patronage  of  King
Charles,  who  was  now  absorbed  in  Sicilian  matters,  the
Florentines  had  organised  the  constitution  in  the  manner
that  suited  them  best,  and  by  entrusting  the  greater
guilds  with  the  management  of  the  State  gained  a  real
predominance  in  Tuscany  that  they  turned  most  skilfully
to  account  for  the  extension  of  their  trade.  The  politico-
commercial  league,  concluded  in  March,  1282,  to  which
we  have  already  alluded,  proved  most  beneficial  to  their
interests,  and  the  subjection  of  neighbouring  towns  and
territories  was  another  means  to  the  same  end.

Nevertheless,  the  two  Ghibelline  cities  of  Arezzo  and
Pisa  still  remained  hostile  to  Florence.  The  former  was
a  threatening  presence  in  the  upper  Val  d'Arno,  while
the  latter,  with  its  wealth,  power,  and  command  of  the

sea,  was  a  danger  to  the  lower  valley,  and,  standing  on
the  road  to  Leghorn  and  Porto  Pisano,  was  an  obstruction
to  the  maritime  trade  of  Florence.  Hence  it  was  obvious
that  sooner  or  later  the  Republic  would  be  forced  to
combine  with  friendly  neighbours  and  new  allies  againgt
both  these  foes,  and  especially  against  Pisa.  Free  access
to  the  sea-board  was  more  indispensable  than  ever  to
the  Florentine  trade,  and  should  Pisa  continue  to  block
the  way,  the  Republic  would  reap  nothing  from  the
successes  it  had  already  achieved.

Meanwhile  the  Florentines  enjoyed  the  benejfits  ot
peace  for  two  quiet  years.  During  this  time  Charles'
son,  the  Prince  of  Salerno,  and  other  members  of  the
royal  house  were  received  in  the  city  with  all  due  pomp
and  parade.  In  March,  1283,  the  king  came  in  person
to  Florence  on  his  way  to  Bordeaux,  where  he  was  to
engage  in  single  combat  with  Peter  of  Aragon,  who  had
been  proclaimed  Lord  of  Sicily  by  the  people  of  the
island.  By  this  much-talked-of  duel,  that  never  took
place,  the  war  desolating  Southern  Italy  was  to  be  brought
to  an  end.  Even  on  this  occasion  the  king,  although
noisily  welcomed  in  Florence,  and  probably  oppressed  by
grave  anxiety,  insisted  on  creating  more  knights,  regardless
of  the  trouble  he  caused  to  the  people.  Nevertheless,
after  he  had  gone,  the  merrymakings  were  continued  with
greater  zest  than  before.  On  St.  John's  Day,  always  a
great  festival  in  Florence,  a  company  was  formed  of  a
thousand  young  men,  who,  clothed  in  white  robes  and  led
by  one  of  their  number  representing  the  *'  Lord  of  Love,"  i
inaugurated  games  and  diversions  of  every  kind,  giving
dances  in  the  streets  and  within  doors  to  persons  of  all
ranks — ladies,  knights,  and  com^non  folk.  This  Court  of
Love  was  in  imitation  of  certain    French  customs    first

'  Villani  says  (vii.  89)  that  this  "  was  the  most  noble  and  renowned
court  ever  held  in  the  city  of  Florence."

introduced  into  Florence  by  the  Angevins.  It  now
numbered  three  hundred  knights,  so-called  di  corredo,
chiefly  created  by  King  Charles,  according  to  the  French
mode.  They  gave  banquets  and  had  a  train  of  pages,
courtiers,  and  buffoons  imported  from  various  parts  of
Italy  and  France.  But  all  this  was  a  fruitless  attempt
to  introduce  customs  opposed  to  the  city's  traditions,  a
childish  means  of  asserting  the  existence  of  a  new  patrician
order.  The  populace  was  enchanted  with  these  gay
doings  ;  but  the  thriftier  citizens  at  the  head  of  the
government,  and  constituting  the  real  strength  of  the
Republic,  highly  disapproved  of  them,  and  were  dis-
gusted to  find  that  after  struggling  so  long  to  repress
the  nobility  fresh  efforts  were  needed  to  stamp  out  its
remains.  Throughout  Tuscany,  indeed,  fresh  warfare
was  impending,  for  the  Sicilian  Vespers  seemed  to  have
roused  the  Imperialists  to  new  vigour.  For  this  reason
Corso  Donati  had  declared,  at  a  consulta  held  on  February
26,  1285,  that  all  districts  appertaining  to  the  Empire
{de  Imperio)  and  bordering  the  Florentine  territory  were
to  be  subject  ad  iurisdictionem  Comunis  Florentiae.^  New
agreements  were  made  to  this  effect  with  the  other
Guelph  cities.2  But  the  most  urgent  consideration  of  all
was  how  to  overcome  the  pride  and  power  of  Pisa,  that
obstinately  Ghibelline  city  with  whom  Florence  had
always  been  compelled  to  struggle,  and  must  now  struggle
anew.  But  how  was  success  to  be  assured .''  Florence
was  neither  willing  nor  able  to  depend  on  the  help  of  the
French  king,  and  even  with  the  combined  aid  of  all
its  allies  could  not  muster  sufficient  strength  for  the
enterprise.  Therefore  much  sagacity  and  diplomatic
skill  were   required   in   order   to   multiply  the  resources

of  the  Republic,  and   the    Florentines   proved   equal   to
the  occasion.

VII.

Although  the  city  of  Pisa  derived  all  its  strength  and
influence  from  its  maritime  trade,  nevertheless — either
from  being  always  on  the  Imperial  side,  or  because  such
was  the  predestined  fate  of  all  Italian  sea-board  republics
— it  was  dominated  by  a  powerful  aristocracy  to  the  same
extent  as  were  Genoa  and  Venice.  With  their  usual
astuteness,  the  Florentines  had  long  sought  to  bring  their
influence  to  bear  on  the  Pisan  nobles,  in  order  to  create
discord  among  them.  Giovanni  Visconti,  entitled  Judge
of  Gallura,  from  the  high  and  remunerative  post  once
held  by  him  in  Sardinia,  as  governor  of  several  provinces,
for  the  Pisan  Republic,  had  been  subsequently  (1274)
exiled  on  account  of  his  Guelph  proclivities,  and  had
then  joined  the  vicar  of  King  Charles  and  the  Guelph
League  against  his  native  state.  He  died  in  1275  >  ^"'i
just  at  that  time  Count  Ugolino  della  Gherardesca,  one
of  the  most  powerful  and  ambitious  nobles  of  Pisa,  who
aspired  to  establish  a  despotism  there,  was  driven  into
banishment  with  other  formidable  Guelphs  (1275).
These  exiles  not  only  made  alliance  with  the  Florentines,
but,  in  conjunction  with  the  League,  or  Taglia^  made  war!
on  Pisa  and  captured  several  castles,  Vico  Pisano  included.l
In  the  September  of  the  same  year  they  returned  to  the:
attack  in  co-operation  with  the  Angevin  vicar-royal.i
Florentines,  and  Lucchese,  and,  defeating  their  fellow-
citizens  at  three  miles'  distance  from  Pisa,  seized
the  Castle  of  Asciano,  which  was  handed  over  to  the
Lucchese.  In  1276  the  war  was  resumed  by  Florenc(
and  Lucca,  and  again  at  the  instigation  of  Count  Ugolinc
and  his  friends.     This  was  the  occasion  alluded  to  at  arl

earlier  page,  when  both  sides  brought  powerful  armies
into  the  field  and  came  to  a  pitched  battle  between  Pisa
and  Pontedera,  on  the  banks  of  the  so-called  Fosso
Arnonico,  a  canal  into  which  the  Pisans  had  formerly
diverted  the  waters  of  the  Arno  for  the  better  defence
of  their  territory.  Again  the  Pisans  were  worsted,  and
the  bitterness  of  defeat  enhanced  by  having  to  accept
peace  on  the  terms  proposed  by  Florence,  of  which  the
first  and  hardest  condition  was  the  readmittance  in  their
city  of  all  the  banished  Guelphs,  and  particularly  of  the
ambitious  Count  Ugolino,  whom  they  hated  so  deeply.

Pope  Gregory  X.  was  highly  displeased  by  this  war,
and  by  the  ardour  and  pertinacity  with  which  it  was  pursued,
for  he  considered  the  Ghibelline  spirit  of  Pisa  a  barrier
to  the  growing  power  of  the  Florentines,  who,  in  spite  of
being  Guelphs,  used  every  effort  to  become  wholly  inde-
pendent of  the  Papacy.  Wherefore,  after  vainly  enjoining
them  to  put  an  end  to  the  war,  he  excommunicated  their
city.  But  the  Florentines  offered  slight  excuses,  and  until
1276  paid  no  attention  to  his  thunders.  Then  at  last
peace  was  declared,  but  during  its  very  brief  duration
plans  were  arranged  for  new  expeditions.

After  this  the  Republic  of  Pisa  enjoyed  a  few  tranquil
years,  and  owing  to  the  vastness  of  its  trade  and  the
extension  of  its  colonies,  its  finances  were  rapidly  restored
to  their  former  prosperity.  Unfortunately,  certain  Pisan
families  had  become  so  powerful  by  means  of  their  wealth
that,  no  longer  satisfied  with  republican  equality,  they
sought  to  dominate  the  internal  affairs  of  the  State  and
direct  its  foreign  policy  in  favour  of  their  personal  ambition
rather  than  of  the  interests  of  the  State.  The  Judges
of  Gallura  and  Arborea,  Counts  Ugolino,  Fazio,  Neri,
and  Anselmo  della  Gherardesca,  all  had  their  own  little
courts  and  men-at-arms  after  the  fashion  of  princes.
Absorbed  in  covetous  rivalries,  they  distracted  the  atten-

tion  of  the  magistrates  from  the  dangers  threatening  their
republic,  and  daily  becoming  graver  and  more  imminent.
For,  in  fact,  the  strength  of  the  Republic  was  not  only
almost    exhausted    by    the    continuous    attacks    of  the
Guelph   League,  but   for  some  time  past   the  rivalry  of
Genoa  had  been  threatening  to  culminate  in  a  still  deadlier
strife.      As   both  these  maritime    cities  were  Ghibelline,
they  had  every  reason  to  be  at  peace  with  each  other  and
combine  in  defending  their  interests  against  the  far  greater
sea  power  of  Venice.     But,   on  the   contrary,  this  only
seemed    to    exasperate   their   reciprocal  jealousy.      Their
fleets  were   constantly  in    collision  in   Levantine  waters.
They  had  a  desperate  encounter  in  1277  near  Constanti-
nople and  on  the  Black  Sea.     It  ended  in  disaster  for  the
Pisans,  who  had  been  the  assailants,  and  from  that  moment
they  panted  for  revenge.     Nor  were  opportunities  lacking.
While  the  Venetians   were   asserting    absolute    dominion
over  the  Adriatic,  the  Genoese  and  Pisans,  hard  by  on  the
Mediterranean,  were  always  crossing  each  other's  tracks,
inasmuch    as    both    were    engaged    in    the    same    trading
ventures,  and  both  possessed  colonies  in  the  same  islands
of  Corsica  and  Sardinia.     Thus,  they  were  involved  in  con-
tinual  conflict.     Then,   too,  as  the   Guelph  League  was
specially  hostile  to  Pisa,  it  supplied  Genoa  with  perpetual
pretexts  for  beginning  the  hostilities  which  the  Florentines  \
were  seeking  to  incite  by  every  political  manoeuvre.     At  1
last  their  reciprocal  hatred  reached  so  high  a  pitch  that
the  Pisans  themselves  were  the  first  to  provoke  the  war.  ;
Their  burning  desire  for  reprisals  was  continually  kept  (
aflame  by  the  greed  of  the  nobles,  who  hoped  to  convert  ■
the    conflict    into    a   ladder   to    power,   and    whose   own  I
ambitions  were  spurred  by  the  crafty  encouragement  of
Florence.

Corsica  was  ruled   by  a  certain  Sinucello,  bearing  the
title  of  Judge  of  Cinarca.      He  had   been  educated  in


IVAjR  between  PISA  AND  GENOA.  277

Pisa,  and  the  Republic  had  assisted  him  to  regain  and
increase  his  hereditary  possessions  in  the  island.     Govern-
ing there  as  a  vassal  of  Pisa,  he  nevertheless  transferred
his  allegiance  to  the  Genoese,  who  occupied  another  part  of
the  island.     Later  on,  after  perpetrating  every  species  of
cruel  and  tyrannous  deeds,  he  turned  against  the  Genoese
and  devastated  their  Corsican  towns.     Taking  refuge  at
Pisa,  that  republic  granted  him  protection  as  a  former  vassal,
equally  regardless  of  the  subsequent  treaties,  by   which
he  had  sworn  fealty  to  Genoa,  and  of  all  the  barbarities
he  had  committed.     Pisa  tried   to  reinstate   Sinucello  in
Corsica  by  force,  but  as  the  Genoese  were  determined  to
keep  him  at  a  distance,  this  served  to  provoke  hostilities.
In  fact,  being  sent  back  to  the  island  with  120  horse  and
200  foot,  he  was  able  to  recapture  his  possessions  ;  but
from  that  moment  (1282)  the  Genoese  and  Pisan  ships
were  always  chasing  one  another  over  the  Mediterranean
in  order  to  engage.     Accordingly,  from  the  end  of  1282
to  the  August  of  1283,  a  continual  series  of  sanguinary
conflicts  took  place,  sometimes  attaining  the  proportions
of  real   naval    battles  ;    and    although    the    Pisans   were
generally  defeated,  they  always  rallied  their  forces,  and
prepared  to  resume  the  struggle.     On  one  occasion  half
their  fleet  perished  in  a  storm  ;  nevertheless,  shortly  after
this  (1284)  they  sent  twenty-four  galleys  to  escort  Count
Fazio   to   Sardinia,    where  collisions    with    the    Genoese
were  of  constant  occurrence.     In  fact,  on  the  ist  of  May,
they  encountered  the  latter's  fleet,  gave  battle,  and  carried
on  an  obstinate  fight  that  lasted  the  whole  day.     Finally,
however,    the  Pisans    were    beaten    ofi^,    leaving    thirteen
galleys  and  a  great  number  of  prisoners  in  the  enemy's
hands.     Notwithstanding  this  reverse,  the  same  year  wit-
nessed   another   naval   battle  between  the  two  republics,
that  proved  one  of  the  most  memorable  fights  on  record
in  the  Middle  Ages.


2  78         THE  DOMINANT  POWER  IN  TUSCANY.

Genoa,  whose  victories  had  cost  her  dear,  caused  vessels
to  be  built  and  equipped  in  every  port  of  the  Riviera  ;
while  Pisa,  although  exhausted  by  so  many  conflicts  on
sea  and  land,  made  prodigious  efforts  of  all  kinds.  By
appealing  to  the  patriotism  of  her  noblest  families,  she
elicited  a  worthy  response.  The  Lanfranchi,  a  numerous
Pisan  clan,  equipped  no  less  than  eleven  galleys  at  their
own  expense  ;  the  Gualandi,  Lei,  and  Gaetani,  furnished
six  ;  the  Sismondi  three  ;  the  Orlandi  four  ;  the  Upez-
zinghi  five  ;  the  Visconti  three  ;  the  Moschi  two  ;  and
other  families  joined  in  equipping  one.  Andrea  Moro-
sini,  the  Venetian,  one  of  the  highest  naval  celebrities  of
the  time,  was  chosen  Podesta,  with  full  powers  to  make  all
requisite  preparations  for  the  war,  and  to  then  assume  the
chief  command  of  the  fleet  at  sea.  Thus  both  sides  sent
forth  the  most  formidable  armaments  to  be  seen  in  those
times.  Genoese  writers  reckon  their  vessels  to  have  been
ninety-six  in  number,  and  those  of  Pisa  seventy-two  ;
whereas  Pisan  historians  reckon  their  fleet  at  103  sail
against  130  of  the  Genoese.  At  any  rate,  both  are  agreed
that  the  Genoese  fleet  outnumbered  the  Pisan,  and  that  its
superiority  was  enhanced  by  the  greater  skill  of  its  com-
manders. The  two  armadas  cruised  in  search  of  each
other  for  some  time,  and  then  tacked  about  before  giving
battle,  each  trying  to  gain  the  better  position.  It  is
averred  that  the  Pisans  sailed  to  the  entrance  of  the  port
of  Genoa,  discharging  silver  arrows  and  balls  covered  with
purple  cloth,  in  order  to  make  a  display  of  wealth,  after
the  usage  of  the  time.  Anyhow,  it  is  known  that  some
of  their  galleys  were  anchored  off  Porto  Pisano,  and  others
lying  in  the  Arno,  between  the  two  bridges  of  the  city,
when  the  news  came  that  the  Genoese  fleet  had  been  sighted.
All  Pisa  was  in  a  turmoil  ;  scattered  crews  hastened  on
board,  and  the  archbishop,  attended  by  his  clergy,  and
bearing  the  banner  of  the  Republic,  appeared  on  the  Ponte


THE  BATTLE  OF  MELORIA,  279

Vecchio,  and  blessed  the  fleet.  Thereupon,  amid  joyful
shouts,  the  galleys  weighed  anchor,  and  swept  down  the
river  to  the  sea.  It  is  related  that  at  the  moment  the
benediction  was  pronounced  the  crucifix  on  the  standard
fell  down,  which  was  judged  a  bad  omen.

The  6th  of  August,  1284,  was  a  memorable  day.  The
two  fleets  met  ofl^  Meloria,  at  a  short  distance  from  Porto
Pisano.  Here  in  past  times  the  Genoese  had  been
severely  defeated  by  the  Pisans,  and  here  they  now  sought
revenge  in  the  famous  battle  so  fully  recorded  by  our
historians.  The  remoteness  of  the  event,  and  the  dis-
crepancies between  Tuscan  and  Genoese  accounts,  make  it
very  difficult  to  obtain  absolute  knowledge  of  all  the
details  of  this  fight.  Accordingly  it  will  be  safer  to  fix
our  attention  on  the  best  ascertained  and  more  remarkable
points.

The  Pisan  fleet  consisted  of  three  squadrons.  Of
these.  Admiral  Andrea  Morosini  commanded  the  first  ;
while  the  second  was  under  Count  Ugolino,  who,  in  spite
of  his  courage,  was  no  trustworthy  leader,  on  account  of
the  devouring  personal  ambition  urging  him  to  subordinate
the  interests  of  the  State  to  his  own  greed  for  power.
The  third  was  commanded  by  Andreotto  Saracini.  Oberto
Doria,  an  officer  of  great  courage  and  experience,  was
high  admiral  of  the  Genoese  fleet.  As  it  first  hove  in
sight,  this  armada  seemed  no  greater  than  that  of  the
Pisans,  but  only  because  a  reserve  of  thirty  galleys,  com-
manded by  Benedetto  Zaccaria,  lay  hidden  behind  Meloria
— or,  according  to  other  accounts,  behind  Montenero —
ready  to  join  in  the  fight  when  required.  Soon  after
midday  the  battle  began,  and  raged  for  some  hours
without  any  decisive  result.  But  when  the  two  flag-ships
met,  both  fleets  closed  in  a  general  engagement.  On  either
side  vast  numbers  of  combatants,  killed,  wounded,  or
stunned,  were   hurled    into   the   sea.      The  waves  were

crimsoned  with  blood ;  drowning  men  clutched  at  oars
to  save  their  lives,  but  were  relentlessly  thrust  under  by
the  rowers'  next  strokes,  owing  to  the  impossibility  of
checking  the  manceuvres  in  the  thick  of  the  fight,  and  at
the  most  critical  moment.  Just  then  Benedetto  Zaccaria,
having  been  signalled  for,  hove  in  sight,  fiill  sail,  and
with  sweeping  oars,  in  time  to  decide  the  fate  of  the  day.
Seeing  him  draw  near,  the  Pisans  knew  they  were  out-
numbered, and  their  courage  began  to  fail,  although  they
continued  the  fight  with  undiminished  ardour.  As  Zac-
caria dashed  in,  he  contrived  to  bring  his  galley  alongside
Doria's,  so  as  to  wedge  Morosini,  whose  flag-ship  was
making  a  gallant  defence.  At  the  same  time  the  galley
bearing  the  Pisan  standard  was  also  surrounded  by  the
foe.  On  all  sides  the  sudden  arrival  of  the  reserve
squadron  had  given  fresh  courage  to  the  Genoese  and
diminished  the  hopes  of  Pisa.  The  struggle  was  now  too
unequal  ;  nevertheless,  both  sides  were  unwilling  to  end
it,  for  each  bitter  enemy  was  seeking  to  destroy  not
only  the  other's  fleet,  but  the  very  life  of  the  rival
Republic,

But  the  conflict  could  not  go  on  for  ever.  The  Pisan
banner,  on  its  tall  iron  shaft,  was  suddenly  seen  to  bend,
and  the  next  instant  it  fell  with  a  horrible  crash  beneath  a
storm  of  blows,  while  at  the  same  moment  the  admiral's
flag-ship  began  to  give  way,  and  Morosini,  who  had  been
shockingly  wounded  in  the  face,  was  forced  to  surrender.
At  this  juncture  Count  Ugolino,  for  his  own  treasonable
purposes,  gave  the  signal  for  flight,  and  thus  completed
the  catastrophe.  Seven  Pisan  galleys  were  sunk,  twenty-
eight  captured  by  the  foe,  while,  according  to  the  inscrip-
tion on  the  Church  of  St.  Matteo  at  Genoa,  no  less  than
9,272  prisoners  were  taken.  Certain  Pisan  writers  raise
the  number  to  eleven,  and  some  even  to  fifteen  thousand  ;
but  this  may  have  included  many  of  the  slain,  who  may


OVERWHELMING  DEFEAT  OF  THE  PI  SANS.    281

undoubtedly  be  reckoned  at  five  thousand.  At  all  events,
after  the  battle  of  Meloria,  it  became  a  common  saying  in
Tuscany  that  one  must  now  go  to  Genoa  in  order  to  see
Pisa,

When  those  who  had  escaped  returned  to  Pisa,  all  the
town  flocked  into  the  streets  to  ask  news  of  their  kindred,
and  nearly  all  had  to  mourn  the  loss  of  some  killed  or
captured  relations.  A  host  of  old  men,  women,  and
children  wandered  about  the  city  maddened  with  despair,
so  that  at  last  the  magistrates  were  forced  to  ordain  that
all  should  keep  to  their  own  homes.  Soon  all  the
inhabitants  were  clad  in  black,  and  only  women  were  seen
in  the  streets.  Genoa,  on  the  contrary,  rejoiced  and
made  glad  ;  but  victory  had  no  wise  softened  its  hatred
against  Pisa.  This  was  proved  when  the  fate  of  the
prisoners  came  to  be  discussed.  Some  citizens  proposed
putting  them  to  a  heavy  ransom  ;  others  to  exchange
them  for  the  Castel  di  Castro  in  Sardinia,  the  key  of
the  Pisan  possessions  there  ;  but  neither  suggestion  was
approved.  Orators  raised  their  voices,  crymg  that  it  were
best  to  retain  the  prisoners  until  the  war  should  be  really
at  an  end.  Thus  the  women,  being  practically  widowed,
but  unable  to  re-marry,  population  would  be  checked,
and  the  Pisan  army  prevented  from  repairing  its  losses.
In  fact,  the  war  continued  sixteen  years  longer  ;  and  by  the
time  the  prisoners  were  released,  their  number  was  reduced

It  is  difficult  to  decide  which  rose  to  greater  proportions
during  these  years — the  heroic  endurance  of  calamity  on  the


«82        THE  DOMINANT  POWER  IN  TUSCANY,

part  of  the  Pisans,  or  the  insatiable  hatred  of  their  victors.
Soon  after  the  catastrophe  of  Meloria,  Florence  and  Lucca
proposed  an  alliance  with  Genoa,  in  order  to  join  that
power  in  completing  the  extermination  of  the  rival
republic.  This  alliance  was  to  be  maintained  for  twenty-
five  years  from  the  conclusion  of  the  war.  Hostilities
were  to  commence  within  fifteen  days,  Genoa  being
pledged  to  provide  fifty  galleys,  and  Florence  and  Lucca
to  furnish  an  army.  Thus  the  allies  could  make  com-
bined attacks  by  sea  and  by  land,  and  were  bound  to  carry
on  the  campaign  for  at  least  forty  days  every  year.  Pisa
understood  that  her  total  overthrow  was  decreed,  and  her
detestation  of  Lucca,  and  still  more  of  Florence,  was  so
keen  that,  to  avoid  yielding  to  those  states,  she  ptofessed
her  readiness  to  accept  instead  the  terms  of  submission
Genoa  had  sought  to  impose.  But  it  was  now  too  late.
On  the  13th  of  October  the  treaty  of  alliance  was  sub-
scribed, in  the  Badia  at  Florence,  by  delegates  from
Lucca  and  Genoa,  together  with  the  representatives  of
Florence,  of  whom  Brunetto  Latini  was  one.  An  arrange-
ment was  also  made  allowing  the  other  Tuscan  cities  to
join  the  League,  and,  what  was  far  more  remarkable,
another  clause  provided  for  the  admission  of  Pisan
prisoners  of  influential  position  who  should  have  sworn  to
make  war  on  their  own  state.  Even  Count  Ugolino,  his
sons,  and  the  Judge  of  Gallura,  were  to  be  admitted  on
the  same  terms,  provided  they  became  Genoese  citizens
and  acknowledged  the  suzerainty  of  Genoa  over  their
estates.  Nevertheless,  no  prisoners  were  to  be  admitted
without  the  general  consent  of  the  allies,  and  were  not  to
exceed  twenty  in  number.  This  clause  clearly  proves  that
many  Pisans  were  traitorous,  or  disposed  to  treason.  Nor
was  Florence  forgetful  of  the  aim  she  had  constantly  in
vievv  ;  for  even  on  this  occasion  she  took  care  to  insert

profitable  commercial  agreements  in  the  treaty  of  political
alliance.!

Several  other  cities  of  Tuscany  speedily  adhered  to  the
League,  and  preparations  for  war  began.  Pisa  was  soon
surrounded  on  all  sides.  The  Florentines  marched  into
Val  d'Era,  the  Lucchese  captured  several  castles,  while
Spinola's  Genoese  squadron  attacked  Porto  Pisano  and
wrought  much  damage  there.  Suddenly,  however,  the
Florentines  showed  so  much  slackness  in  lending  their
aid,  as  to  excite  the  grave  discontent  of  Lucca  and  Genoa.
Their  chief  object  was  to  promote  their  own  commerce  ;
hence,  while  anxious  to  break  Pisa's  pride,  and  reduce  the
city  to  submission  on  the  plan  pursued  with  other  Tuscan
towns,  it  did  not  suit  their  views  to  let  the  Genoese  usurp
the  chief  share  of  the  work,  much  less  the  lion's  share
of  the  profit.  Yet,  as  things  stood,  the  latter's  naval
superiority  rendered  this  result  only  too  certain.  For,
were  Genoa  once  mistress  of  Pisa,  the  Mediterranean
would  be  practically  hers,  and,  with  so  much  increased
power,  would  be  truly  formidable  to  Florence.

Accordingly,  after  raising  such  a  host  of  enemies  against
Pisa,  the  Florentines  now  tried  to  turn  things  to  their  own
exclusive  advantage,  and,  with  the  usual  double  dealing  of
the  period,  paid  little  respect  to  the  treaties  they  had  sworn
to  observe.  The  Pisans  instantly  saw  their  opportunity
and  sought  to  profit  by  it  ;  but  in  so  bungling  a  fashion
as  to  hasten  their  ruin.  As  we  have  already  related,  they
had  vainly  attempted  to  come  to  terms  with  Genoa  ,  and,
their  grievous  calamities  rendering  them  unable  to  cope
with  assailants  equally  formidable  by  land  and  by  sea,  they
now  made  endeavours  to  conciliate   Florence.     For  this


'  Ammirato  gives  full  details  of  this  treaty.  A  summary  of  the
original  document  was  afterwards  included  by  Canale,  in  his  "  Nuova
Istoria  della  Repubblica  di  Geneva"  (the  Le  Monnier  edition),  vol.  iii.

purpose  they  nominated  Count  Ugolino  to  the  ofRce  of
Podesta,  and  even  entrusted  him  subsequently  with  the
direction  of  the  war,  in  spite  of  the  general  belief  that  he
had  played  the  traitor  at  Meloria.  For,  knowing  him  to
be  Guelph,  and  secretly  favourable  to  the  Florentines,  they
considered  him  fitted  to  fulfil  their  purpose  of  detaching  the
latter  from  the  Genoese  interests.  They  knew,  also,  that
the  count  was  absorbed  in  the  single  idea  of  establishing
his  own  domination  in  Pisa  ;  therefore  he  would  be  ready
to  come  to  terms,  if  required,  with  the  enemies  of  his
country,  and  be  capable  of  the  worst  crimes  in  order  to
gratify  his  enormous  ambition.  But,  this  ambition  once
sated,  the  Pisans  believed  that,  possessing  many  friends
among  the  Guelphs,his  courage  and  astuteness  would  enable
him  to  arrange  satisfactory  terms.  This  proved  to  be  the
case,  but  his  intervention  led  to  very  unexpected  results.

The  chroniclers  relate  that  Ugolino  sent  the  rectors  of
Florence  a  present  of  Vernaccia  wine,  with  gold  florins  at
the  bottom  of  every  flask  as  a  bribe.  ^  This  legend  merely
signifies  that  he  was  considered  capable  of  employing  any
means  to  attain  his  own  ends.  At  all  events,  he  was
obliged  to  impose  very  cruel  sacrifices  on  Pisa  before  the
Florentines  could  be  induced  to  suspend  hostilities.  It
was  necessary  to  cede  important  domains,  castles  such  as
Sta  Maria  a  Monte,  Fucecchio,  Sta  Croce,  and  Monte
Calvoli,  and  to  restore  the  city  to  the  Guelphs  by  banishing
all  the  Ghibellines — the  direst  humiliation  to  a  republic
that  had  always  been  steadfastly  Ghibelline.  But,  with
her  very  existence  at  stake,  Pisa  was  bound  to  submit  even
to  this.

When,  however,  the  Genoese  and  Lucchese  discovered

that  the  Florentines  had  deserted  them  and  were  sidinsr

with    Pisa    against   Lucca,   they    complained    so    bitterly

of  this  breach  of  faith,  that  Count  Ugolino  deemed  it

well  to  at  least  silence  Lucca  by  the  cession  of  Bientina,
Ripafratta,  and  Viareggio.  In  this  manner  the  haughty
Pisan  Republic  was  stripped  of  nearly  all  its  territories
outside  the  city  gates,  and  deprived  of  all  power  of
defending  the  coast,  at  a  time  when  its  ships  were  being
chased  and  plundered  by  the  Genoese  on  every  sea
Amid  the  general  ruin  and  desolation,  however,  Ugolino
triumphed  ;  for  now,  being  absolute  lord  of  Pisa,  his  dearest
desire  was  fulfilled.  Nevertheless,  his  power  was  much
less  secure  than  he  supposed,  for  the  fiery  Pisan  spirit  was
not  entirely  extinguished,  and  already  the  majority  of  the
citizens  were  growing  intolerant  of  a  tyranny  at  home
failing  to  spare  them  humiliations  abroad.  The  smallest
occasion  served  to  show  that  public  feeling  was  on  the
verge  of  an  outbreak.

Much  discontent  was  also  provoked  in  the  course  of
negotiations  with  Genoa  for  the  restitution  of  the  prisoners,
comprising  many  of  Pisa's  best  sons.  Their  release  was
desired  at  any  cost ;  but  the  count,  knowing  them  to  be
Ghibellines,  and  consequently  opposed  to  himself,  daily
invented  fresh  obstacles  to  prevent  their  return,  and
by  proposing  terms  the  Pisans  could  not  accept,  always
caused  fresh  delays.  Thus,  as  he  intended,  no  conclusion
could  be  arrived  at.  But  his  arrogance  finally  produced
discord  even  among  his  own  party.  His  nephew,  Nino
Visconti,  judge  of  Gallura,  and  the  natural  head  of
the  Guelph  faction,  began  to  make  overtures  to  the
Ghibellines  for  the  purpose  of  combating  his  uncle.
Thereupon  Ugolino  promptly  sent  many  other  Ghibellines
into  exile,  and  demolished  ten  of  their  grandest  palaces.
This  produced  an  outburst  of  indignation.  Nino  made
close  alliance  with  the  Gualandi  and  Sismondi,  and  all  tried
to  hasten  the  prisoners'  release,  while  the  count  found
fresh  pretexts  for  delay  by  reviving  causes  of  dispute
with  Genoa.


286         THE  DOMINANT  POWER  IN  TUSCANY.

After  vain  attempts  to  rouse  the  people  against  him,
Nino  and  his  friends  resorted  to  legal  measures,  hoping  in
this  way  to  curb  his  tyrannous  excesses.  He  had  been
nominated  Captain-general  of  the  people,  but  had  illegally
usurped  the  office  of  Podesta  in  addition,  and  fixed  his
residence  in  the  palace  of  the  Signory,  where  he  had  no
right  to  dwell.  His  nephew  and  the  others  sued  him  for  this
before  the  Anziani^  and  obliged  him  to  leave  the  palace  in
conformity  with  the  law.  He  obeyed  for  a  short  time,  but
soon  resumed  his  former  supremacy  by  force.  Mean-
while, party  hatred  grew  stronger,  the  count  fomenting
discord  with  Genoa,  while  his  enemies,  as  another  means
to  his  overthrow,  were  doing  their  utmost  to  conclude
peace  and  deliver  the  prisoners.

At  last  the  count  discerned  his  peril,  and  tried  to  find
some  way  of  escape.  Seeing  that  certain  Guelphs  were
no  less  hostile  than  the  Ghibellines  and  had  joined  with
them  against  him,  he  decided  on  conciliating  the  latter,  in
order  to  detach  them  from  the  Guelphs  who  had  forsaken
his  cause.  Thus  he  might  at  once  defeat  these  deserters,
and,  having  isolated  the  Ghibellines,  find  it  easy  to  destroy
them  later  on.

But,  in  spite  of  these  ingenious  devices,  both  parties
finally  combined  against  him,  under  the  command  of
Archbishop  Ruggiero,  one  of  the  most  powerful  of  the
Ghibellines.  Civil  war  raged  in  the  city  ;  the  public  palace
was  alternately  seized  by  the  archbishop,  and  re-captured
by  the  count ;  while  the  latter,  blinded  by  his  fury  for
revenge,  rejected  the  warnings  and  advice  of  even  his
closest  adherents.  One  day,  when  the  popular  discontent
}ud  come  to  a  climax,  in  consequence  of  the  high  price  of
provisions,  and  no  one  ventured  to  inform  him  of  it,  one
of  his  nephews  demanded  audience,  explained  the  state  of
things,  and  advised  him  to  suspend  the  levying  of  customs,
so  as  to  lower  the  price  of  food.     But  this  enraged  the


DOWNFALL  OF  COUNT  UGOLINO.  287

count  to  such  a  point  that,  drawing  his  dagger,  he  stabbed
the  speaker  in  the  arm.  A  nephew  of  the  archbishop
chanced  to  be  present,  and  being  a  friend  of  the  wounded
man,  rushed  forward  to  shield  him  from  further  attack.
Thereupon  the  count,  maddened  with  fury,  caught  up  an
axe  that  lay  near,  and  with  one  blow  stretched  the  intruder
dead  at  his  feet.

The  Archbishop  Ruggieri  dissimulated  for  a  while,
waiting  his  chance  to  take  revenge.  It  came  at  last.  On
July  I,  1288,  the  council  of  the  Republic  was  assembled
in  the  Church  of  St.  Sebastian  to  discuss  the  arrangement
of  peace  with  Genoa.  Both  the  Ghibellines  and  people
yearned  for  peace  at  any  cost ;  but  the  count  raised  fresh
obstacles,  still  relying  on  the  support  of  his  friends.  As
the  meeting  dispersed,  the  archbishop  perceived  that  the
favourable  moment  had  arrived,  and  that  no  time  must
be  lost.  The  Gualandi,  Sismondi,  Lanfranchi  and  other
houses  joined  with  him,  and  all  proceeded  to  attack
Ugolino.  The  latter  made  a  valiant  resistance,  aided  by
two  of  his  sons,  two  nephews,  and  a  few  devoted  followers.
After  the  first  encounter,  in  which  Ugolino's  natural  son
was  slain  before  his  eyes,  he  took  refuge  in  the  palace  of
the  people,  and  defended  it  from  midday  to  dusk,  when
the  besiegers  decided  to  set  it  on  fire.  Then,  forcing
their  way  through  the  flames,  they  captured  the  count,
with  his  two  younger  sons,  Gaddo  and  Uguccione,  and  his
nephews  Nino,  surnamed  Brigata,  and  Anselmuccio.  The
prisoners  were  thrown  into  the  Gualandi  tower  on  the
Piazza  degli  Anziani,  and  Ruggieri  kept  them  most  closely
confined  there  for  several  months.  ^  Finally  the  key  of
the  tower  was  cast  into  the  Arno,  and  all  left  to  die  of
starvation,  amid  the  torments  immortalised  by  Dante's  pen. 2

'  Some  of  the  chroniclers  assert  that  the  archbishop  hoped  to  extract
large  sums  of  money  from  his  captives  before  making  an  end  of  them.

288         THE  DOMINANT  POWER  IN  TUSCANY.

IX.

These  events,  while  still  further  reducing  the  strength
of  the  unfortunate  city,  likewise  caused  the  overthrow  of
the  Pisan  Guelphs,  by  once  more  driving  them  into  exile,
and  promoted  the  hopes  of  the  Ghibellines,  who  now
seemed  to  have  gained  new  life  in  Tuscany.  Accordingly
Florence  was  again  compelled  to  recur  to  arms.  Charles
I  of  Anjou  was  no  more,  and  Pope  Honorius,  being
favourable  to  the  Ghibellines,  had  instigated  his  kinsman,
Prenzivalle  del  Fiesco,  to  assume  the  post  of  vicar-
imperial  in  Tuscany-  But  as  the  cities  of  the  League  gave
him  a  very  rough  reception,  he  retired  to  Arezzo,  and
vainly  promulgated  edicts  against  the  Guelphs.  By  this
time  no  one  heeded  the  words  of  Imperial  vicars.  On
realising  this  he  went  back  to  Germany,  leaving  Arezzo
a  prey  to  conflicts,  in  which  the  Ghibellines  won  the  victory,
with  the  help  of  numerous  Florentine  exiles.  The
Guelphs  sought  refuge  in  neighbouring  castles,  whither
reinforcements  reached  them  from  the  Florentine  Signory.
Thus  the  war  spread  even  to  the  Upper  Val  d'Arno ;  for
as  the  Ghibellines  had  returned  to  power,  both  in  Arezzo
and  Pisa,  led  by  the  spiritual  lord  of  either  town,  they
had  now  to  be  encountered  on  two  sides.  In  Pisa  their
chief  was  the  Archbishop  Ubaldini,  in  Arezzo,  Guglielmo
degli  Ubertini,  an  equally  Ghibelline  prelate.  The  latter
was  also  a  better  warrior  than  priest,  the  lord  of  many
strongholds,  and  being  of  a  very  slippery  nature,  first
attempted  to  betray  the  city  to  the  Florentines,  in  return  for  I
an  agreement  guaranteeing  him  his  possessions.  The  men
of  Arezzo  contrived,  however,  to  compel  him  to  keepj
faith  with  his  own  party.     On  June  i,  1288,  the  army  or

the  League  took  the  field.     It  comprised  nobles  and  ppo-

lani  from  every  part  of  Tuscany,  and  together  with  the

mercenary  troops  reached  a  total  of  2,600  horse  and  1 2,000

foot.    They  carried  on  the  campaign  for  twenty-two  days,

capturing  and  razing  about  forty  castles,  great  and  small,  on

the  Aretine  territory ;  but  then  a  great  storm  wrought  so

j  much  damage  to  their  encampments,  that  they  were  forced

•  to  beat  a  retreat.    As  a  mark  of  insult  to  the  enemy,  they

had  held  races  under  the  walls  of  Arezzo,  naming  twelve

knights    di  corredo ;  ^  but    then,   raising   the   siege,  they

went  back  to   Florence,  leaving  their  foes   unconquered

and  undismayed.     In   fact,  when  the  Siennese  separated

ifrom  the  main  body  on  the  way  to  their  own  city,  they

I  were   surprised    by  a  band  of  Aretines  La  ambush,  and

;!  thoroughly  routed.

During  the  month  of  August  the  Florentines  joined
with  the  Pisan  Guelph  exile,  Nino  di  Gallura,  made  raids
on  Pisan  lands,  and  occupied  the  Castle  of  Asciano  ;  then,
:;  in  September,  they  marched  against  the  Aretines,  who  had
"I  now  gathered  an  army  of  seven  hundred  horse  and  eight
thousand  foot.  No  pitched  battle,  however,  took  place,
for  the  enemy  retreated  before  the  Florentines,  leaving
them  to  devastate  the  country  at  their  will,  but  after-
wards made  reprisal  in  the  beginning  of  1289,  by  laying
waste  the  Florentine  territory,  and  penetrating  almost  as
far  as  San  Donato.  These  variously  important  skirmishes
paved  the  way  for  more  serious  hostilities.

All  Tuscany  was  now  preparing  for  war.  The  captain
elected  by  Pisa  was  Count  Guido  da  Montefeltro,  who
had  risen  to  the  highest  distinction  by  his  victory  over  the
French  troops  of  Charles  of  Anjou  at  the  battle  of  Forii
He  was  undoubtedly  one  of  the  bravest  warriors  of  the
'time,  and  on  his  arrival  in  Pisa  quickly  reorganised  the
[militia,  and  created  a  new  body  of  light  infantry  of  three

thousand  crossbowmen,  able  to  do  good  service  against
the  heavy  cavalry  then  considered  the  chief  strength  of  an
army.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Aretines  increased  their
forces  so  much,  that  when  Charles  II.  of  Anjou  passed
through  Florence  on  the  way  to  his  coronation  in  Naples,
the  Florentines  were  obliged  to  grant  him  an  escort  of
their  best  horse  and  foot  soldiers,  to  protect  him  from
the  attack  threatened  by  the  men  of  Arezzo,  On  this
occasion  they  asked  the  king  for  a  good  leader,  to  enable
them  to  pursue  the  campaign  energetically,  and  Amerigo
de  Narbonne  being  appointed  to  the  post,  he  joined  them,
accompanied  by  William  de  Durfort  and  one  hundred
men-at-arms.

On  June  2,  1289,  the  new  captain,  Narbonne,  took  the
field  with  an  army  of  one  thousand  horse  and  ten  thou-
sand foot  soldiers  of  the  League.     It  comprised  the  flower
of  the    Florentine    nobles    and   commons,    including    six
hundred  of  the  best-equipped  knights  ever  furnished  by
the  city.     Prato,  Pistoia,  Sienna,  and  all  the  allies,  includ-
ing the  Guelphs  of  Romagna,  had   sent  their  due  con-
tingents.    Meanwhile  the  Aretines  had  collected  all  the
Ghibellines  from  neighbouring  cities,  and  were  encamped
at  Bibbiena  with  eight  hundred  horse  and  eight  thousand
foot,  under  the  command  of  their  captains,  the  greatest  1
of  whom  was  the  daring  Bishop  Guglielmo  degli   Uber-  I
tini.     On    finding    that   he   could  not  make  terms    with  j
Florence  to  secure   his  own  strongholds,  without  being  !
exposed  to  the  vengeance  of  the  Aretines,  he  had  plunged
into  the  war  with  youthful  ardour.      His  conduct  was  j
arrogant  and  full  of  assurance  ;  for  he  relied  on  his  own  j'
courage  and  that  of  his  men,  and  despised  the  Florentines,  [
because,  so  he  said,  they  were  as  sleek  as  womenfolk.  \

On  the  nth  of  June  the  two  armies  met  in  the  plain  off
Poppi,  near  Campaldino,  where  the  engagement  began,  j.
The  battle  is  known  by  that  name,  and  rendered  all  the  i

more  celebrated    by  the  fact   of   Dante  Alighieri — then
young  and  unknown — having  fought  in  it.     The  Floren-
tines had  placed  a  mixed  host  of  infantry,  crossbowmen,
and    bucklermen     in    the    van,    and    their    wings    were
formed    of   150   skirmishing   light    horse,   who    were  all
picked  men.    Vieri  de'  Cerchi  was  among  the  latter  ;  for,
having  been  entrusted   with   the   choice  of  those  of  his
sestiere^  he  insisted,  in  spite  of  illness,  on  accompanying
his  son  and  nephews  to  the  battlefield.      In  the  rear  of
the  first  division  a  stronger  force  of  heavy  cavalry  and
infantry  was  drawn  up,  with  the  baggage-train  behind.
Corso  Donati  led  a  band  of  about  250  foot  and  horse
from     Lucca,     Pistoia,    and    foreign    parts.        He    was
Podesta   of   Pistoia   at    the    time,   and  was   directed   to
hold  his  reserve  back  until  the  commander-in-chief  gave
the  signal  to  advance.     On  either  side  there  was  a  fever  of
emulation  between  the  Guelphs  and  the  Ghibellines,  and
to  gratify  the  ambition  of  their  respective  leaders,  some
were  awarded  the   honour  of  knighthood   that  day,  in
order  to   spur   them  to  greater  feats.     The  Florentines
were  under  orders  to  await  the  enemy's  charge,  and  Messer
tSimone  dei  Mangiadori   of  San  Miniato  shouted  to  his
men,  '^Signori  !  our  Tuscan  battles  used  to  be   won  by
vigorous  assault,  but  are  now  to  be  won  by  standing  still."
'The   Aretines,   on    the   contrary,  trusting  to   their    own
courage  and  their  leader's    skill,   made  so  impetuous    a
charge  to  the  cry  of  "  Viva  San  Donaio!  "  that  the  Floren-

presence  of  mind,  and  by  failing  to  attack  the  foe  at  the
moment  when  their  ranks  were  in  confusion,  caused  much
harm  by  the  delay.  But  this  was  his  usual  behaviour,
and  presently,  as  the  fight  grew  hotter,  he  took  to
flight — also  as  usual.  On  the  other  hand,  Corso  Donati,
although  instructed  to  keep  his  men  steady,  and  not  to
advance  until  expressly  summoned,  could  not  remain
inert  on  beholding  the  Florentines  waver  at  the  first
shock  of  encounter,  and  cried  aloud,  *'  If  we  lose,  I  will
perish  with  my  fellow-citizens  ;  if  we  win,  let  who  likes
come  to  Pistoia  to  punish  our  disobedience  ; "  and  so
saying,  gave  the  command  to  take  the  enemy  in  flank.
Thus  the  attacking  Aretines  were  now  charged  in  their
turn.  They  made  an  admirable  resistance,  and  their
cavalry  being  insufficient,  the  infantry  crawled  on  all  fours
among  the  advancing  troops,  and  disembowelled  their
steeds.  But  no  prodigies  of  personal  courage  could  avail
to  decide  the  battle.  There  was  a  fierce  and  prolonged
melee  ;  the  Florentines  fought  stubbornly,  and  nearly  all
the  leaders  of  the  Aretines  were  killed.  Archbishop
Ubertini  fell,  sword  in  hand  ;  so,  too,  his  nephew,
Guglielmino  dei  Pazzi,  held  to  be  one  of  the  bravest
captains  in  Italy,  and  Buonconte,  the  Count  of  Monte-
feltro's  son.  Many  Florentines  perished,  including  three
of  the  Uberti  and  one  of  the  Abbati.  Count  Guide
Novello  alone  saved  his  skin  by  flight.  The  Aretines
were  thoroughly  routed,  and,  according  to  Villani,  left
seventeen  hundred  dead  on  the  field,  and  two  thousand
prisoners  in  the  enemy's  hands.  But  of  these  only
740  reached  Florence,  the  rest  having  escaped  or  been
ransomed.  This  is  not  very  surprising,  when  we  re-
member that  in  these  Guelph  and  Ghibelline  wars  fellow-
citizens,  and  old  friends  or  relations,  often  had  to  meet
in  combat  ;  and  that  consequently  leniency  was  more
natural  than  hatred,  although  there  are  only  too  many


VICTORY  OF  THE  FLORENTINES.  293

instances  of  the  ferocity  to  which  the  latter  feeling
was  carried.  The  Florentine  losses  were  slight  and  un-
important. Corse  Donati,  whose  daring  charge  greatly
contributed  to  decide  the  struggle,  and  Vieri  de'  Cerchi
were  both  covered  with  glory.  Many  men  previously
deemed  of  little  account  won  high  reputation  that  day,
while  many  others  forfeited  their  fame.  At  any  rate,  all
the  best  citizens  and  captains  returned  safely  to  Florence,
and  there  was  general  rejoicing  in  the  city.^

The  Florentines  had  felt  assured  of  victory  from  the
outset.  In  fact  we  are  told  that  the  priors,  having
fallen  asleep  on  the  day  of  the  battle,  worn  out  by
their  previous  vigils,  they  were  suddenly  awakened  by
the  sound  of  a  voice  seeming  to  cry  :  "  Arise,  for  the  Are-
tines  are  beaten."  At  that  moment  all  the  citizens  were
in  the  streets,  waiting  impatiently  the  arrival  of  news.
At  last  the  desired  messenger  appeared,  and  there  was  an
outburst  of  joy  and  festivity.  Later  on  discontent  was
excited  by  hearing  that  the  army  had  failed  to  follow  up
the  victory  by  giving  pursuit  to  the  foe.  For  had  the
latter  been  driven  back  into  Arezzo,  that  town  might
have  been  easily  seized.  Instead  of  this,  the  forces  cap-
tured Bibbiena,  belonging  to  the  bishop,  plundered  several
'  castles,  and  devastated  the  country  for  twenty  days.
They  ran  races  round  the  walls  of  Arezzo,  and  used  their
rams  to  drop  asses  crowned  with  mitres  into  the  town,  in
order  to  insult  its  inhabitants.  But  they  suspended  all
serious  hostilities  for  the  time,  although,  when  the  new
,  priors  had  been  chosen,  the  government  at  once  despatched
\  two  of  them  to  the  camp,  in  order  to  push  forward  the
i  war  in  person,  and  hasten  the  capture  of  the  city.  But
the  favourable  moment  had  passed,  for  the  Aretines  made
some  successful  sallies,  and  set  fire  to  all  the  besiegers*
engines  of  assault.     Accordingly,  leaving  a  sufficient  force

to  guard  the  captured  castles  and  unfinished  sipge-works,
the  Florentines  returned  home  on  the  23rd  of  July,  much
to  the  displeasure  of  the  citizens,  who  murmured  that  the
enemy's  gold  must  have  been  poured  into  the  camp.
Nevertheless,  a  great  victory  had  been  won,  and  the  soldiers
were  received  with  vast  demonstrations  of  delight.  All
the  people,  with  the  banners  and  insignia  of  every  guild,
and  the  whole  of  the  clergy,  went  forth  in  procession  to
welcome  the  conquerors.  The  Captain,  Amerigo  de  Nar-
bonne,  and  Ugolino  de*  Rossi,  the  Podesta,  entered  the
town  in  state,  beneath  sumptuous  canopies  of  cloth  of
gold,  borne  by  the  noblest  of  Florentine  knights.  The
entire  cost  of  the  campaign  was  paid  by  levying  a  property
tax  of  six  lire^  six  soldi  per  cent,  in  the  city  and  its  terri-
tory. This  tax  soon  yielded  a  product  of  thirty-six
thousand  gold  florins,  owing,  as  Villani  remarks  (vii.  132),
to  the  admirable  administration  and  organisation  of  the
financial  affairs  of  the  Commune  at  that  time.

After  humiliating  the  two  hostile  cities  of  Arezzo  and
Pisa,  the  Florentine  Republic  had  overthrown  the  Ghibel-
lines  and  assured  the  triumph  of  the  Guelphs  throughout
Tuscany,  and  thus  gained  almost  unlimited  influence,  both
political  and  commercial.  Hence  there  was  a  vast  and
rapid  increase  of  prosperity.  Great  festivities  and  banquets
were  held  in  all  the  wealthiest  houses,  and  palace  courtyards,
covered  with  silken  canopies  and  draped  with  gorgeous
stuffs,  served  as  places  of  entertainment  for  the  citizens.
In  token  of  rejoicing  the  womenfolk  paraded  the  streets
wearing  garlands  of  flowers.  Nevertheless,  there  was  a
general  wish  to  continue  the  war,  in  the  hope  of  com-
pleting the  overthrow  of  the  two  most  powerful  Ghibelline
cities.     This,  however,  was  no  easy  task.

In  1289  there  were  fresh  skirmishes  between  the  Guelphs
and  Ghibellines,  although  none  of  any  importance.  The
Florentines  made  several  attempts  to  capture  Arezzo  by


ABORTIVE  SIEGE  OF  AREZZO.  295

force  and  by  fraud,  but  always  in  vain.  In  November
they  had  contrived  a  secret  arrangement  by  means  of  which
it  was  hoped  to  surprise  the  city.  A  decree  was  suddenly
issued  summoning  all  able-bodied  men  to  assemble  outside
the  walls  before  a  candle  lighted  at  one  of  the  gates
should  have  time  to  burn  down.  The  army  thus  hastily
gathered  made  a  forced  march  on  Arezzo  ;  but  the  treason
plotted  there  had  been  already  discovered  :  a  dying  man,
rumour  said,  having  revealed  it  to  his  confessor.  At  any
rate,  the  army  was  obliged  to  withdraw  from  a  bootless
errand.

In  the  June  of  the  ensuing  year,  1290,  the  Florentines
resumed  the  campaign  with  an  army  of  1,500  horse  and
6,000  foot,  furnished  by  the  League.  Surrounding  Arezzo,
they  devastated  the  territory  within  a  circuit  of  six  miles,
for  the  space  of  twenty-nine  days,  but  without  achieving
any  farther  result.  At  that  period  all  cities  were  fortified,
and  before  the  invention  of  gunpowder  siege  operations
had  no  chance  of  success,  save  by  treason,  against  a  resolute
defence.  Now,  too,  the  Florentines  were  trying  to  carry
on  a  double  campaign,  against  Arezzo  on  the  one  hand
and  Pisa  on  the  other.  In  fact,  presently  leaving  three
hundred  horse  and  a  considerable  number  of  foot  soldiers
to  garrison  the  neighbouring  strongholds,  they  transferred
the  rest  of  the  army  from  the  Upper  to  the  Lower  Val
dArno,  to  act  against  Pisa.

In  the  preceding  year,  aided  by  Florence  and  the
League,  Lucca  had  taken  the  field  with  four  hundred
horse  and  two  thousand  foot,  in  order  to  carry  on  the  war
with  Pisa,  while  the  Florentines  were  busied  with  Arezzo.
This  force  encamped  before  Pisa,  and,  according  to  usage,
held  races  there ;  harried  the  territory  for  twenty-five
days,  captured  the  Castle  of  Caprona,  and  made  several
assaults  on  Vico  Pisano,  but  achieved  no  farther  result.
Now,  in  T  290,  the  Florentines  resumed  the  attack  in  com-


296        THE  DOMINANT  POWER  IN  TUSCANY,

binatlon  with  all  the  great  forces  of  the  League.  And  while
this  army  was  making  a  general  attack  by  land,  the  Genoese
fleet  swooped  down  on  the  coast  with  deadly  effect.
Leghorn  and  Porto  Pisano  were  taken,  the  four  towers
guarding  the  harbour  were  thrown  into  the  sea,  and  the
Meloria  lighthouse  destroyed  in  the  same  way,  together
with  its  keepers.  Before  setting  sail  the  Genoese  blocked
the  mouth  of  the  harbour  by  sinking  four  ships  laden  with
ballast,  and  demolished  all  warehouses  and  palaces.  But
the  havoc  wrought  by  land  was  confined  to  the  destruction
of  crops  and  the  demolition  of  petty  strongholds.  Mean-
while the  Pisans  made  a  brave  resistance  on  all  sides.
Guido  di  Montefeltro,  their  captain,  used  his  newly
invented  troop  of  light  horse  to  excellent  effect  against
the  Tuscan  infantry  of  the  League  and  the  heavy  cavalry
in  its  pay.  By  his  successful  sallies  he  repeatedly  achieved
a  bloody  revenge  for  past  losses.  In  December,  1291,
the  Pisans  marched  on  the  Castle  of  Pontedera,  and  finding
it  slackly  defended,  accomplished  its  capture,  and  shortly
afterwards  stirred  the  Castle  of  Vignale  to  revolt  against
San  Miniato.  Thereupon  the  Florentines  decided  on
sending  an  army  to  provoke  a  fresh  engagement ;  but  the
expedition  was  too  long  delayed,  and  the  troops  had  hardly
started  before  torrents  of  rain  inundated  the  country  and
compelled  them  to  retreat.

Military  operations  now  slackened  more  and  more,
for  mischief  was  brewing  in  the  city,  and  all  men  foresaw
that  worse  troubles  were  at  hand.  Therefore,  although
urged  to  resume  hostilities  by  their  valiant  and  energetic
leader,  the  Judge  of  Gallura,  the  Florentines  so  sorely
needed  tranquillity  that  they  finally  concluded  a  treaty  ot
peace  at  Fucecchio  on  June  12,  1293,  According  to  its
stipulations,  all  prisoners  of  war  were  to  be  released  ;  no
duties  were  to  be  levied  on  inhabitants  of  the  communes
of  the  League  in  passing  through  Pisa,  nor  on  Pisans


PEACE  ARRANGED  WITH  PISA.  agj

passing  through  the  said  communes.  The  office  of  Podesta
or  Captain  of  Pisa  was  only  to  be  held  by  a  member  of
the  League,  and  it  was  expressly  forbidden  to  confer  that
post  on  any  rebel  or  adversary  of  the  said  League,  or  any  ^
scion  of  the  Montefeltro  house.  Further,  Count  Guido,
the  brave  chief  who  had  shown  so  much  energy  and  daring
in  defence  of  the  Pisan  Republic,  was  to  be  dismissed,
together  with  all  the  foreign  Ghibellines  ;  and  twenty-five
citizens  of  the  best  Pisan  blood  were  to  be  given  in
hostage  to  secure  the  due  observance  of  the  terms.  Such
was  the  reward  of  the  veteran  leader's  fidelity  and  heroism  !
On  being  paid  off,  he  entered  the  council  chamber,  and
after  reproving  the  ingratitude  of  the  Pisans  in  dignified
words,  took  his  leave  without  expressing  any  wish  for
revenge.  Yet,  being  still  in  command  of  an  experienced
army  devoted  to  himself,  vengeance  lay  in  his  power,  had
he  chosen  to  follow  the  fashion  of  the  times.  Another
clause  of  the  treaty  provided  that  the  descendants  of  Count
Ugolino  and  the  Judge  of  Gallura  should  be  freed  from
outlawry  and  reinstated  in  all  their  possessions.*

From  this  moment  the  Florentines  devoted  their  chief
attention  to  the  affairs  of  the  city,  although  these  had  not
been  altogether  neglected,  even  during  the  last  wars.  Con-
tinual improvements  had  been  made  in  the  administration
of  the  Republic,  and  in  many  respects  it  was  a  model
administration,  while  there  was  also  a  notable  increase  of
commerce,  trade,  and  wealth.  At  the  same  time  many
public  works  had  been  completed  under  the  direction  of
the  famous  architect  Arnolfo  di  Cambio,  the  creator  of

'  Villani,  Compagni,  Ammirato,  and  the  Pisan  historians  previously
quoted.

some  of  the  grandest  public  buildings  in  Florence.  He
planned  the  alterations  for  the  enlargement  of  the  city,
first  undertaken  in  1285,  and  afterwards  built  the  third
circuit  of  walls,  the  which  work  was  also  superintended  by
the  celebrated  chronicler  Giovanni  Villani.  It  was  likewise
by  Arnolfo's  care  that  the  Loggia  of  Or'  San  Michele,  then
used  as  a  corn  market,  was  built  in  and  paved,  the  Piazza
dei  Signori  supplied  with  a  pavement,  and  the  Badia  embel-
lished and  restored.  Folco  Portinari,  the  father  of  Dante's
Beatrice,  founded,  at  his  own  expense,  the  church  and
hospital  of  Santa  Maria  Nuova.  The  Piazza  of  Santa
Maria  Novella  was  laid  out,  and  many  other  public  works
of  a  similar  kind  were  begun. ^

Meanwhile  political  reforms  were  uninterruptedly  carried
on,  and  among  them  the  notable  measure  passed  in  1289,
reducing  the  Podesta  s  term  of  office  from  twelve  to  six
months.2  The  post  was  then  conferred  on  Rosso  Gabrielli
of  Gubbio,  a  city  supplying  many  Podestas  and  Captains
of  the  people  not  only  to  Florence,  but  to  all  parts  of  Italy.
At  that  period  Romagna,  Umbria,  and  the  Marches
seemed  to  be  a  nursery  of  these  dignitaries,  the  inhabi-
tants of  those  provinces  being  not  only  well  trained  to
arms,  as  is  proved  by  the  horde  of  captains  and  soldiers
of  adventure  they  sent  forth,  but  also  well  versed  in
the  legal  lore  of  the  neighbouring  university  of  Bologna.
This  reduction  to  six  months  of  the  Podesta's  tenure
of  office  was  not  long  maintained,  but  had  been  decreed
for  the  same  motives  as  the  change  of  Signory  every
two  months.  The  power  of  a  magistrate  authorised  to
administer  justice,  in  command  of  the  army  and  invariably
escorted  by  a  body  of  armed  followers  in  his  private  pay,
might  be  easily  transformed  into  a  formidable  despotism,

SIGNIFICANT  DISTURBANCES,  299

as  several  Italian  republics  had  already  found  to  their
cost.  Hence  it  was  endeavoured  to  avert  this  danger
from  Florence  by  changing  the  magistrates  so  frequently
as  to  allow  no  time  for  hatching  plots  against  the  Com-
monwealth, or  forming  a  party  whose  adherence  could  be
counted  on  for  any  length  of  time.

But  political  and  social  changes  of  a  very  different  and
far  graver  kind  were  now  brewing  among  the  citizens  of
Florence.     Signs  of  a  new  and  radical  transformation  were
becoming  daily  more  pronounced  ;  hence  the  greater  need
of  assuring  peace  in   order  to    withstand  the    inevitable
and    imminent    shock    of    coming     revolutions.       The
presence  of  the  Angevins  in  Florence,  the  example  set  by
their  nobles,  and  their  continual  creation  of  new  knights,
had  swelled  the  arrogance  of  the  leading  Guelphs  to  a
boundless  extent.     These  patricians  were  now  known  by
the   name  of  grandly    and    in    imitation    of  the    French
nobility   assumed  manners  ill-suited  to  a  republican  state,
trying  to  rule  everything  and  all  men  according  to  their
will.    A  serious  riot  took  place  in  1287,  because  one  of  these
chieftains,  named  Totto  Mazzinghi,  being  condemned  to
death    by    the    Podesta    for    murder    and    other    crimes,
Messer    Corco   Donati,    one    of  the    leading    nobles    of
Florence,  attempted  to  rescue  him  by  force  on  the  way  to
the  .^scaffold.      Thereupon   the    Podesta,  resenting    such
open  violation  of  the  law,  caused  the  alarm  bell  to   be
rung.     The    people    flocked    to    the    place    of  execution
sword  in  hand,  some  mounted,  some  on  foot,  to  the  cry
of  *'  Giustizia^   Giustizia  ! "   and  the  sentence  was  then
carried  out  with  the  uttermost  rigour  of  the  law.     The
condemned  Mazzinghi   was  dragged  through   the  streets
before  being  hung  ;  the  promoters  of  the  revolt  against
the  magistrates  were  heavily  fined,  and  order  was  re-estab-
lished in  the  city.     But  these  disturbances  were  indicative
of  deeper  evils  to  come,  and  Florentine  statesmen   were

full  of  anxiety.  In  order  to  check  the  arrogance  of  the
grandly  and  prevent  them  from  combining  with  the
populace,  the  middle-class  Guelphs  began  to  grant  political
rights  on  a  continuously  wider  scale,  while  restricting  the
power  of  the  nobles.  As  we  have  already  seen,  the  latter
had  been  obliged  to  provide  sureties  personally  responsible
for  their  actions,  to  swear  to  abstain  from  deeds  of
vengeance,  from  oppressing  the  people  and  so  forth.
The  very  remarkable  law  passed  on  August  6,  1289,
served  to  overthrow  the  might  of  the  nobles,  both  within
and  without  the  city  walls,  and  to  enhance  that  of  the
people  by  destroying  the  last  lingering  remains  of  the
feudal  system.  Thanks  to  this  decree,  serfdom  was
entirely  abolished  throughout  the  territory  ;  for  in  terms
resembling  a  proclamation  of  the  rights  of  man,  It  declared
liberty  to  be  an  imprescriptible,  natural  right,  a  right
never  to  be  dependent  on  another's  will  ;  and  that  the
Republic  was  determined  not  only  to  maintain  liberty
intact  throughout  its  dominions,  but  likewise  increase  the
same. I  Thus  every  species  of  bondage,  whether  for  a
term  or  for  life,  was  abolished,  together  with  all  contracts
or  agreements  infringing  on  the  liberty  of  the  individual.
It  has  been  thought  by  some  writers  that  the  Commune
of  Bologna  had  already  achieved  this  most  important
reform  in  1256,  and  that  Florence  only  followed  its
example  thirty-three  years  later.  But  this  was  an  error
induced  by  supposing  that  in  the  Italian  communes  the
abolition  of  serfdom  was  completed  at  one  stroke,  whereas,
on  the  contrary,  it  was  carried  out  very  slowly  and  in
different  degrees.  In  the  territory  there  were  not  only
nobles  and  their  serfs^  but  also  Jideles^  whose  personality
was  already  recognised  by  law,  but  who  still  remained  de-
pendents of  the  nobiles  and  bound  to  yield  them  service
and  tribute.     At  a  later  date  the  condition  of  the  fi deles

•  Vide  Note  A  at  the  end  of  this  chapter.


COMPLETE  ABOLITION  OF  SERFDOM.         301

was  further  ameliorated  ;  they  could  hold  land  in  fee  from
their  lords,  or  by  payment  of  a  yearly  rent  (a  livello),  but
remained    bound   to    them    on   terms    of  villeinage,  and
therefore  bound  to  the  soil.      For  this  reason  the  lords
believed,  or  feigned  to  believe  themselves  entitled  to  sell
the  soil,  together  with  the  Jideles  attached  to  it,  even  when
this  was  no  longer  in  accordance  with  the  spirit  of  the  law.
The    Bolognese   abolished   serfdom    in     1256,   but    the
peasantry  remained  in  their  master's  dependence,  that  is,
more  or  less  2.%fideles^  and  although  these  conditions  were
ameliorated  in   1283  they  were  not  altogether  abrogated.
But  even  earlier  than  1289  serfs  had  ceased  to  exist  in
the  Florentine  territory,  and,  judicially,  th^  Jideles  had  been
long    considered    almost    independent    of    their   masters,
although  the  latter,  by  the  abuse  of  purely  personal  con-
tracts, often   compelled  them   to  remain  attached  to  the
soil  and  claimed  the  right  of  disposing  of  them,  as  well  as
of  the  land.     These  were  the  abuses  condemned  and  sup-
pressed by  the  Florentines  in   1289,  as  being  adverse  to
liberty,  "  the  which  is  a  natural  and  therefore  inalienable
right."     The  new  law  likewise  decreed  that  in  consequence
of  this  natural  right  all  the  above-mentioned  sales  became
null  and  void  ;    and  cancelling  every  illegal  contract,  it
finally    guaranteed    complete  freedom  to  the  peasantry.
And   by  another   clause  every  peasant   was    thenceforth
enabled  (irrespective  of  any  sale  of  the  land)  to  purchase
his  emancipation  from  any  personal  contract  binding  him
to  the  proprietor  of  the  soil.     Thus  the  law  of  1289  did
not  abolish  serfdom,  inasmuch  as  that  institution  had  been
already  suppressed  by  the  Florentines  some  time  before,
but  it  assured,  for  the  first  time,  complete  liberty  to  the
cultivators  of  the  soil.     Economically,  the  new  law  was
very  advantageous  to  the  Commune,  by    converting  the
peasantry  into  direct  contributors,  and  no  less  advantageous
to  the  democracy,  inasmuch  as  it  broke  the  last  links  of


302         THE  DOMINANT  POWER  IN  TUSCANY.

the  feudal  system,  and  weakened  the  power  of  the  nobles
throughout  the  contado.^

Many  other  measures  were  also    passed  in   1289   and
1290  for  the  purpose  of  strengthening  the  position  of  the
people  in  the  city,   and  serving  to  show   that   Florence
steadily  pursued  the  work  of  political  and  social  transfor-
mation.    First  of  all,  the  number  of  legally  constituted
guilds  was  increased  by  adding  five  more   to  the  seven
greater  guilds,  and  all  having  their  special  insignia,  organi-
sation,   arms,  and    political    attributes.2     We    now    find
records  of  twelve  greater  guilds  in  the  archives  of  the
Republic,  whereas,  previously  to  this  date,  seven  only  were
mentioned.     It  is  true  that  the  number  was  very  soon
reduced  again  to  seven  ;  but  then  the  five  omitted  were
joined  to  nine   others,  these  fourteen  designated   as   the
lesser  guilds,  and  the   total    number    of  the   guilds  was
finally  fixed  at  twenty  one.     In   1290  another  law  was
passed,   called  the  law  of  prohibition^  decreeing   that   no
prior  could  be  re-elected  to  oflace  until  three  years  had
elapsed.     Later  on  this  prohibition  was  partially  extended
even  to  the  kinsmen  of  a   prior.3     The   scope   of  these
measures  was  always  to   prevent  the   rise  of  any   future
tyranny  and  to  keep  the  growing  arrogance  of  the  nobles
in  check.

Other  laws  were  also  framed  for  the  same  purpose.
As,  for  instance,  the  two  decrees  carried  almost  unani-
mously on  June  30,  and  July  3,  1290.4    By  these  all  guild-

'  Prof.  P.  Santini  has  treated  of  this  question  in  his  article  entitled
"  Condizione  personale  degli  abitanti  del  contado  nel  secolo  xiii.,"
"Arch.  Stor.  It."  (Series  iv.  vol.  xvii.  p.  178  and  fol).  He  justly  remarks
that  there  is  no  basis  of  comparison  between  the  Bolognese  law  of  1256
and  the  Florentine  law  of  1289,  seeing  that  they  relate  to  persons  of  a
different  class  and  to  two  different  periods  of  the  movement  set  on  foot
in  every  commune  for  ameliorating  the  conditions  of  the  inhabitants  of
the  contado  (p.  188  and  fol.).

IMPORTANT  MEASURES  OF  REFORM.  303

masters  were  prohibited,  under  severe  penalties,  from
forming  monopolies,  agreements,  compacts,  fictitious  sales,
or  other  arrangements  tending  to  the  imposition  of
arbitrary  prices,  regardless  of  the  rules  prescribed  by
statute.  And  not  only  the  individuals  guilty  of  such
infringment  were  subject  to  punishment  and  to  be
mulcted  in  the  sum  of  100  lire.,  but  the  guild  to  which
they  belonged  was  also  subject  to  a  fine  of  500  lire  for
neglecting  to  enforce  obedience  to  the  laws,  and  its
rectors  and  consuls  were  to  be  mulcted  in  200  lire.

On  January  2,  1291,  another  law  was  passed  of  a  far
weightier  import,  with  the  clearly  expressed  aim  of  curb-
ing by  force  the  wolfish  rapacity  of  the  nobles  (volentes
lupinas  carnes  salsamentis  caninis  involvi).i  This  decree
rigorously  prohibited  recourse  to  any  tribunal  or  magis-
trate save  to  the  legally  constituted  authorities,  such  as  the
priors,  the  Captain,  Podesta,  or  the  judges  in  ordinary  of
the  Commune,  All  persons  having  obtained  from  the
Pope,  Emperor,  King  Charles,  or  their  respective  vicars
exemptions  of  any  kind,  or  right  of  appeal  to  other  magis-
trates, and  pretending  to  exercise  such  right,  and  all
persons  who,  with  the  same  intent,  should  assert  the  power
of  exercising  old  feudal  privileges,  were  warned  to  refrain
from  attempting  to  use  such  rights  under  penalty  of  the
severest  punishment.  The  new  law  minutely  described
different  forms  of  similar  fictitious  exemptions,  and
determined  the  penalties  incurred  by  their  use.  What
seems  strangest  of  all  is,  that  this  law  decreed  the  punish-
ment not  only  of  persons  asserting  and  trying  to  exercise
the  above-mentioned  rights,  of  the  notaries  transcribing
the  acts,  and  the  lawyers  declaring  them  valid  ;  but  in
cases  where  the  real  criminals  should  escape  punishment,  it
likewise  held  responsible  the  relations  and  distant  connec-
tions of  the  guilty,  and  even  their  labourers  and  tenants.

304         THE  DOMINANT  POWER  IN  TUSCANS.

At  that  period  the  populace,  the  well-to-do  burghers  and
the  nobles  (^grandi)  formed  as  it  were  three  classes  of
citizens,  or,  indeed,  three  distinct  social  bodies,  who  both
for  offence  and  defence,  in  all  questions  of  party  rancour,
revenge  or  political  privilege,  acted  as  though  every  one
was  willingly  and  of  necessity  bound  to  be  responsible  for
the  deeds  of  his  colleagues.  Hence,  recognising  this  state
of  things,  certain  extreme  measures  were  decreed,  which,
although  opportune  and  even  imperative  at  the  moment —
in  order  to  forward  the  democratic  cause  by  assisting  the
weak  to  struggle  against  the  powerful  class — were  none
the  less  arbitrary.  However,  the  necessity  of  employing
the  most  stringent  remedies  was  becoming  daily  more
obvious.  The  nobles  had  been  too  much  uplifted  by  the
favours  heaped  on  them  by  the  Pope  and  the  Angevins,
And  the  brilliant  success  recently  achieved  at  Campaldino,
where  victory  had  been  decided  by  the  prowess  of  Corso
Donati  and  Vieri  de'  Cerchi,  had  so  swelled  their  pride
that  they  openly  vaunted  their  contempt  for  the  law,  and
constantly  violated  its  prescriptions.  This  state  of  things
finally  produced  the  revolution  of  1293,  resulting  in  the
constitution  of  the  second  popular  government  (//  secondo
popolo)  and  the  total  overthrow  of  the  nobles.

This  law  was  read  and  approved  of  in  the  general  and  special
council  of  the  captain  and  of  the  capitudini,  as  was  the  custom,  but
not  in  that  of  the  Podesta.  It  has  been  published  many  times,  but

NOTE  B."

The  defender  of  the  artisans  and  of  the  guilds,  Captain  and
Conservatore  of  the  city  and  commune  of  Florence,  brought  forward
the  proposal  in  the  special  and  general  council  on  June  30,  1290,
"  presentibus  et  volentibus  Dominis  Prioribus  Artium,"  and  the
proposal,  carried  almost  unanimously  {placuit  quasi  omnibus),  ran
as  follows  : — "  Quia  per  quamplures  homines  civitatis  Florentic  fide
dignos,  rclatum  est  coram  officio  dominorum  Priorum  Artium,  quod
multi  sunt  artifices  ct  comunitates  seu  universitates  Artium  et  earum
Rectores,  qui  certum  modum  et  formam  indeccntem,  et  certum  pre-
cium   incongruum   iraponunt   in    eorum  mercantiis  et  rebus  eorum


NOTE  B.  307

Artium  vendendis  contra  iustitiam  et  Rempublicam."  It  ended  by
strictly  forbidding  every  sort  of  monopoly  and  every  contract  of  sale
arranged  in  a  manner  contrary  to  custom  or  to  the  laws,  "et  quod
dogana  aliqua  vel  compositio  non  fiat  contra  honorem  et  iurisdictionem
Comunis  Florentie,  per  quam  vel  quas  prohibitum  sit  a  Rectoribus
vel  Consulibus  ipsorum  Artis,  quod  aliqui  vel  aliquis  ad  certum
modum  et  certam  formam  et  certum  precium  vendant,  vel  vendere
debeant  mercantias,"  ec.  To  which  Guidotto  Canigiani  added,  that
the  signory  should  henceforward  formulate  other  articles,  not  so  as
to  weaken  the  said  provision,  but  only  to  strengthen  it  more  and
more  in  the  interest  of  the  guilds.  And  his  amendment  was  approved
together  with  the  provision  itself  (State  Archives,  Florence,  Prov-
visioni,  Registro  iv.  c.  29).  And  on  the  3rd  of  July,  by  reason  of
the  former  amendment,  the  priori  of  the  guilds,  together  with  the
otherwise  men  consulted  by  them,  decreed  :  "Quod  nulli  Consules
vel  Rectores  alicuius  Artis,  aut  aliquis  alius,  vice  et  nomine  alicuius
Artis,  vel  aliqua  singularis  persona  alicuius  Artis,  utatur  aliquo  ordina-
mento  scripto  vel  non  scripto,  extra  Constitutum  Artis  approbatum
per  Comune  Florentie,  vel  aliter  vel  ultra  quam  contineatur  in
statuto  talis  Artis,  ec.  .  .  .  Et  siqua  facta  essent  in  contarium  vel
fierent  in  futuro  tacite  vel  expresse,  non  valeant  nee  teneant  ullo
modo  vel  iure,  sed  sint  cassa  et  irrita  ipso  iure  ec.  Et  quod  null  us
notarius  vel  alius  scriptor  scribere  debeat  aliquid  de  predictis  vel
contra  predicta,  et  nullus  nuntius  vel  alius  precipiat  aliquid  aliquibus
artificibus  contra  predicta  :  sub  pena  Rectori  et  Consul!  contrafa-
cienti  auferenda  librarum  cc.  pro  quolibet  et  qualibet  vice  ;  et  Arti,
librarum  quingentarum  ;  et  sub  pena  librarum  centum  pro  quolibet,
qui  observaret  talia  ordinamenta  vel  precepta  prohibita ;  et  sub  pena
libr.  centum  cuilibet  qui  de  predictis  ordinamentis  prohibitis  faceret
precepta  Arti  seu  artificibus  alicuius  Artis."  This  provision  was  to
be  read  in  the  captain's  council  every  month  and  cried  about  the
city.     (Provvisioni,,  Registro,  iv.  a.  c.  30-31.)

NOTE   C.

On  the  31st  of  January  (new  style,  1291)  a  provision  was  made,
beginning  with  this  singular  proemium  : — "Ad  honorem,  ec.  Ut
cives  ct  comitatini  Florentie  non  opprimantur  sicut  hactenus  oppressi
sunt,  et  ut  hominum  fraudibus  et  malitiis  que  circa  infrascripta  com-
mitti  solent,  debitis  remediis  obvietur  et  resistatur,  quod  quidem
videtur  nullomodo  fieri  posse,  nisi  iuxta  sapientis  doctrinam,  dicentis
quod  contraria  suis  purgantur  contrariis;  ideoquo  volentes  lupinas
carnes  salsamentis  caninis  involvi  et  castigari  debere,  ita  quod  lupi

rapacitas  et  agni  mansuetudo  pari  passu  ambulent,  et  in  eodem  ovili
ivant  pacifice  et  quiete,"  ec.

It  goes  on  to  severely  forbid  that  any  one  should  dare  to  :
•'aliquas  litteras  impetrare  vel  impetrari  facere,  aut  privilegium  vel
rcscriptum,  per  quas  vel  quod  aliquis  vel  aliqui  de  civitate  vel  districtu
Florentie  citentur  vel  trahantur  ad  causara,  questionem  vel  litigium
aut  examen  alicuius  indicis,  nisi  coram  domino  Potestate,  Capitaneo
et  aliis  officialibus  Comunis  Florentie  ; "  and  that  he  who,  having
falsified,  did  not  cease  from  falsifying,  when  reprimanded,  and  failed  to
pay  damages  and  interest  within  three  days,  was  to  be  fined  one  hun-
dred small /or/7z/,  or  more,  according  to  the  judgment  of  the  Podesta
or  of  the  captain,  or  of  any  other  magistrate  who  had  undertaken  the
prosecution.  And  if  any  one  sought  to  disobey  or  escape  from  the  juris-
diction of  the  magistrates,  "teneantur  Potestas  et  Capitaneus,  qui  de
predictis  requisitus  esset,  condemnare  patrem  vel  filium  vel  fratrem
carnalem  vel  cuginum  ex  parte  patris  vel  patruum  et  nepotes  eius,  ec,
in  dicta  pena,  et  dictam  condemnationem  exigere  cum  effectu,  et  etiam
in  maiori  pena,  ad  arbitrium  eorum  et  cuiuscunque  eorum,  si  eis  vel
alteri  eorum  videbitur  expedire.  Et  nichilominus  compellat  eos  et
quemlibet  eorum  dare  et  facere  tali  contra  quem  dicerentur  tales
littere  vel  privilegium  vel  rescriptum  impetrata,  omnes  expcnsas  quas
faceret  vel  fecissit,  occasione  predicta,  credendo  de  predictis  expensis
iuramento  huiusmodi  contra  quem  dicerentur  predicta  vel  aliquod
predictorum  impetrata."

Moreover,  as  we  have  said  before,  any  one,  who  in  the  city,
Commune,  or  district  of  Florence,  directly  or  indirectly  published  such
acts,  together  with  the  notary  who  wrote  them  out,  and  the  lawyer
who  defended  them,  was  subject  to  severe  penalties.  The  Podestk
and  the  captain  could  proceed  as  they  pleased  against  any  one  who,
"  audeat  vel  presumat  facere  precipi  eis  vel  alicui  eorum,  quod  faciant
aliquid  vel  ab  aliquo  desistant,  vel  citari  Potestatem  vel  Capitaneum
vel  Priores  vel  Consiliarios  vel  aliquem  officialem  Comunis  Florentie,
vel  eorum  offitia  impedire  vel  retardare  coram  aliquo  vel  aliquibus,  ex
autoritate  aliquarum  licterarum,  privilegii  vel  rescripti,  vel  ex  auctori-
tate  alicuius  indicii  ordinarii,  delegati  vel  subdelegati,  vel  vicarii,"
And  as  usual  the  penalties  could  be  applied  to  relations.

As  it  happened  that  many  requested  the  support  of  civil  justice
{brachium  secular e)  "  in  deffectum  iuris  et  in  lesionem  et  in  preiuditium
personarum  et  locorum  subdittorum  Comuni  Florentie,"  ec,  it  was
decreed  that  this  support  should  be  given  only  when  the  suit  was  over,
before  competent  magistrates,  and  after  it  had  been  examined.  If  in
this  case  the  magistrates  refused,  then  action  could  be  taken  against
them.     But  otherwise,  those  who  should  demand  an  unjust  sentence


NOTE  C.  309

were  subject  to  penalties,  together  with  their  relations,  according  to
the  first  paragraph  of  this  law.  "Verum  si  consanguineos,  ut  dictum
est,  non  haberet,  procedatur  contra  bona  talis  pretentis  brachium
seculare,  et  contra  inquilinos,  laboratores,  pensionaries  et  fictaiuolos
eiusdem  potentis,  et  illorum  cuius  occasione  petitur,  et  ad  alia  pro-
cedatur, prout  ipsis  dominis  Potestati  vel  Capitaneo  et  Prioribus
videbitur  expedire."  Two  other  paragraphs  follow,  of  which  there
are  ten  in  all,  but  at  this  point  a  gap  occurs  in  the  manuscript,
{Provvisioni,  Registro  ii.  a.  c.  175-177).


CHAPTER  VI.


THE  COMMERCIAL   INTEI^ESTS  AND  POLICY  OF  THE
GREATER   GUILDS  IN  FLORENCE.'


I.


"^^^^S^


^^  HE  end  of  the  thirteenth  century  marks
the  opening  of  a  new  era  in  the  history
of  Italy  and  of  Europe.  During  the
period  of  poHtical  disorder  prevaiHng
throughout  Northern  Europe  ever  since
the  days  of  Charlemagne,  a  literary
culture  was  nevertheless  developed,  which,  although  little
heeded  in  past  times,  has  been  most  clearly  elucidated  by
recent  learned  research.  The  literature  of  Provence,  the
romance  of  chivalry,  the  poems  arranged  in  the  cycles  of
Charlemagne,  the  Round  Table,  the  Nibelungen  Lied,
the  innumerable  ballads,  the  splendid  cathedrals  reared
on  both  banks  of  the  Rhine  and  constituting  an  art
never  to  be  surpassed  by  its  countless  imitators,  were  one
and  all  the  offspring  of  the  mighty,  primitive  culture  of
the  Middle  Ages,  in  which,  for  a  long  time,  Italy  had  no
share.  In  Northern  Europe,  where  conquerors  and

never  entirely  fused  with  their  conquerors ;  gradually,
rather,  they  began  to  assert  their  individuality  and  their
rights.  The  original  rise  of  the  communes  was  the  result
of  this  struggle.  Accordingly,  at  the  time  when  France
was  composing  love-songs  and  poems  of  chivalry,  Italy  was
absorbed  in  founding  political  institutions  and  preparing
to  win  freedom.

At  the  beginning  of  the  fourteenth  century  the  scene
was  completely  changed.  Every  branch  of  mediaeval
literature  seemed  smitten  with  an  instantaneous  decay,
northern  imagination  and  fancy  to  be  suddenly  withered.
Even  there,  in  the  north,  men  begin  to  strive,  slowly  and
painfully,  at  the  task  of  political  organisation.  Mean-
while, the  Italian  communes  being  already  constituted,
our  country  had  already  given  birth  to  a  national
literature,  of  so  dazzling  a  splendour  as  to  banish  all
others  from  view,  and  relegate  to  centuries  of  oblivion  the
fruits  of  earlier  culture  elsewhere.  It  was  precisely  at
this  moment  that  Florence,  then  the  chief  seat  and  centre
of  the  new  Italian  culture,  was  subject  to  the  rule  of  the
greater  guilds.  The  Empire  seemed  to  have  abandoned
its  pretentions  with  regard  to  Italy ;  the  Papacy,  weakened
and  menaced,  no  longer  dared  to  impose  its  commands
on  the  secular  world  in  its  former  imperious  fashion  ;  the
struggle  between  conquerors  and  conquered  had  come  to
an  end,  all  distinction  between  the  German  and  Latin
races  having  utterly  disappeared,  and  Italy  being  peopled
by  Italians  alone.

Now,  too,  the  prolonged  conflict  waged  by  the
democracy  of  Florence  against  the  feudal  aristocracy  was
about  to  terminate  in  the  former's  victory,  and  the  Common-
wealth could  be  justly  entitled  a  Republic  of  merchants,
whose  trade  was  soon  to  enrich  them  to  an  apparently
fabulous  extent.  All  seemed  to  herald  a  new  era  of
peace,  prosperity,  and  concord.     But  in  the  light  of  after


3i«  THE  GREATER  GUILDS.

events  we  perceive  that  the  Republic  continued  to  be
sorely  harassed  by  internecine  strife  ;  also  that,  in  spite  of
the  splendid  results  achieved  in  art  and  commerce,
political  institutions  were  on  the  wane,  and  the  loss  of
liberty  becoming  almost  a  foregone  conclusion.  How
was  it  that  a  Commune,  enabled  to  assert  its  existence  at
the  beginning  of  the  twelfth  century  and  steadily  progress
in  the  face  of  tremendous  obstacles,  should  now  show
symptoms  of  decline  in  the  heyday  of  its  triumph  ?
How  was  it  that  civil  war  should  still  be  carried  on  when
all  motive  for  discord  seemed  extinguished  by  the  victory
of  the  popular  party  now  at  the  head  of  the  State  ?  We
shall  discover  the  answer  to  this  problem  by  investigating
more  closely  the  new  conditions  of  Florentine  society,  and
more  particularly  the  conditions  of  the  trade  guilds
constituting  its  chief  strength  and  nucleus.

The  number  of  the  Florentine  guilds  welded  in  associa-
tions had  been,  after  various  changes,  finally  fixed  at
twenty-one  :  seven  greater  and  fourteen  lesser  guilds,
although  often  found  otherwise  divided  into  twelve
greater  and  twelve  lesser.  At  any  rate,  the  guilds  of
first  rank  and  decidedly  highest  importance  v/ere  the
following  : —

1.  The  Guild  of  Judges  and  Notaries.

2.  The  Guild  of  Calimala,  or  Dressers  of  Foreign
Cloth.

3.  The  Guild  of  Wool.

4.  The  Guild  of  Silk,  or  of  Porta  Santa  Maria.

5.  The  Guild  of  Money-changers.

6.  The  Guild  of  Doctors  and  Druggists

7.  The  Guild  of  Skinners  and  Furriers,

As  every  one  can  see,  the  first  on  the  list  is  altogether
outside  the  limits  of  trade  and  commerce,  and  seems
rather  to  belong  to  the  learned  professions.  But  it  may
be   remarked   that   in   those    days   judges    and   notaries


JUDGES  AND  NOTARIES,  313

contributed  very  largely  to  the  advancement  of  the  guilds,
and  were  continually  employed  in  their  service.  Together
with  the  consuls,  they  constituted  the  court  or  tribunal
of  every  guild,  and  gave  judgment  in  all  commercial  suits
tried  there  ;  they  arranged  all  disputes,  pronounced  or
suggested  penal  sentences.  Then,  too,  it  was  the  peculiar
function  of  the  notaries  to  draw  up  new  statutes,
continually  reform  them,  and  provide  for  their  due
enforcement.  They  were  likewise  engaged  to  prepare
contracts,  and  were  frequently  the  mouthpieces  of  the
consuls  at  the  meetings  of  the  greater  and  lesser  guilds.
Good  judges  and  notaries  were  in  great  demand  through-
out Italy,  and,  as  necessary  instruments  of  prosperity,
richly  remunerated  for  their  services.  Accordingly,  their
guild  became  one  of  the  most  influential  in  Florence,  and
its  notaries  were  reputed  the  best-skilled  in  the
world.  Goro  Dati  speaks  of  this  guild  in  his  "  Storia  di
Firenze,"  saying  that  '*  it  has  a  proconsul  at  the  head  of
its  consuls,  wields  great  authority,  and  may  be  considered
the  parent  stem  of  the  whole  notarial  profession  through-
out Christendom,  inasmuch  as  the  great  masters  of  that
profession  have  been  leaders  and  members  of  this  Guild.
Bologna  is  the  fountain  of  doctors  of  the  law,  Florence  of
doctors  of  the  notariate."  ^  At  public  functions  the
proconsul  took  precedence  over  all  the  consuls,  and  came
directly  after  the  chief  magistrate  of  the  Republic.  As
head  of  the  judges  and  notaries  he  held  judicial  authority,
as  it  were,  over  all  the  guilds.

The  four  next  in  order — /.<?.,  the  Calimala,  Wool,  Silk,
and  Exchange — commanded  the  largest  share  of  Florentine
commerce  and  industry.  They  were  of  very  ancient
origin.  Ammirato  remarks  that  the  consuls  of  the
guilds  are  mentioned  in  a  Patent  of  1204,  but  there  is
documentary  record  of  them  at  a  much  earlier  date.     But,

314  THE  GREATER  GUILDS,

although  boasting  so  old  an  existence,  the  guilds  passed
through  a  long  period  of  gradual  formation,  only
developing  their  strength  much  later,  and  each  at  a  different
time.  The  oldest  and  also  the  first  to  make  progress
were  the  Calimala  and  Wool  Guilds,  virtually  exercising
almost  the  same  industry,  inasmuch  as  both  dressed
woollen  stuffs,  and  carried  on  an  extensive  business  with
them.  Nevertheless,  seeing  that  each  pursued  its  trade  in
a  way  peculiar  to  itself,  and  achieved  thereby  a  special
individual  importance,  the  two  guilds  always  remained
separate  and  distinct  from  each  other.

From  the  earliest  mediaeval  times  the  manners  and
customs  of  the  Italians  had  been  more  refined  and  civilised
than  those  of  barbarian  peoples,  and  their  handicraft  far
more  advanced.  We  learn  from  a  chronicler,  quoted  in
Muratori,  that  when  Charlemagne  was  in  Italy  he  wished
to  go  out  hunting  one  day,  and  suddenly  summoned  his
courtiers  from  Pavia.  Precious  Eastern  stufi^  having  been
already  brought  to  that  town  by  the  Venetians,  the
courtiers  were  able  to  appear  before  the  emperor  clad  in
the  richest  attire.  But  during  the  hunt  their  precious
stuffs  and  feathers  were  totally  spoiled  by  rain  and  thorns,
whereas  the  emperor's  plain  tunic  of  goatskin  was  as
good  as  before.  Thereupon  Charlemagne  turned  to  his
followers  and  said,  rather  jeeringly  :  *'  Why  do  you  throw
away  your  money  so  fruitlessly,  when  you  might  wear
skins,  the  most  convenient,  lasting,  and  least  expensive  of
garments }  "^  We  may  certainly  doubt  the  historic  truth
of  this  incident  ;  but  the  chronicler's  tale  proves  two
things  at  all  events,  i.e.,,  that  the  custom  of  wearing  the
skins  of  goats  or  lambs  was  so  general  in  the  ninth
century,  that  even  an  emperor  might  not  disdain  their
use ;   and  that,  although  Italian   industry  was  then  very

THE  WOOLLEN  TRADE.  315

undeveloped,    beautiful   stuffs   were   procured    from    the
Levant  through  the  Venetian  traders.


The  art  of  weaving  coarse  woollen  stuffs  is,  however,
so  easy  that  it  must  have  been  soon  revived  in  Italy,  and
was  probably  never  completely  abandoned.  It  would
seem  to  have  first  begun  to  progress  by  imitating  the
simpler  fabrics  of  the  Eastern  Empire,  where  cultivation
and  industry  had  survived  to  a  much  later  date.  In  fact,
all  the  earlier  Italian  stuffs  bear  names  indicative  of  their
Byzantine  derivation,  such,  for  instance,  as  Velum
holosericum^  Fundathum  alithinum^  Vela  tiria^  bizantina^
Crysoclava^  (ffc.^  Nevertheless,  although  the  craft  of
woollen  manufacture  is  of  very  early  origin,  and  was  even
practised  by  pastoral  tribes,  there  were  many  obstacles  to
its  development  in  Italy.  Improvement  in  the  breeding
of  sheep,  and  consequently  in  pasturing  and  agriculture,
was  required  for  its  progress.  But,  whereas  the  Italian
communes  showed  great  solicitude  for  the  promotion  of
trade,  they  not  only  despised  but  often  crushed
agriculture.  The  Republic  was  constituted  and  governed
by  artisans,  who,  after  overthrowing  the  feudal  lords,  rose
to  supremacy  ;  but  the  agricultural  class,  although  far
better  treated  in  Tuscany  than  elsewhere,  remained  long
bound  to  the  soil,  and  never  enjoyed  rights  of  citizenship.
This  fact  alone  serves  to  indicate  the  rest.  All  laws  and
decrees  relating  to  trade  are  full  of  good  sense  and
foresight ;  while  all  concerning  agriculture  seem  dictated
by  prejudice  or  jealousy.

Then,  too,  regarding   pasturage  and   consequently  the

3i6  THE  GREATER  GUILDS.

woollen  industry,  it  should  be  added  that  Tuscany,  being
a  mountainous  country,  is  adapted  to  the  culture  of  vines
and  olives  and  excellent  cereals,  but  deficient  in  meadow-
land,  whether  natural  or  artificial.  Accordingly,  it  was
an  exceedingly  difficult  task  to  improve  the  quality  and
quantity  of  the  wool  produced  there.  Although  the
Florentines  soon  succeeded  in  manufacturing  the  woollen
stuffs  called  pignolati,  schiavini^  and  villaneschi^  these
very  coarse  fabrics,  the  names  of  which  sufficiently  indicate
their  quality,  only  served  for  a  limited  trade  in  the
territory  or  just  beyond  the  borders  of  the  Republic.
And  when  it  was  attempted  to  improve  the  manufacture
serious  difficulties  arose.  To  weave  fine  cloth  from  coarse
wool  was  a  fi-uitless  labour  ;  while  to  procure  foreign  wool
from  distant  countries  was  no  easy  task  in  times  when
industry  and  commerce  had  scarcely  any  existence,  and
the  cost  of  transport  would  have  devoured  the  profits
Nevertheless,  it  was  by  conquering  all  these  obstacles  that
the  Florentines  gave  the  first  proofs  of  their  genius  for
trade.

In  Flanders,  Holland,  and  Brabant  far  better  wool  was
obtainable,  and  the  art  of  weaving  it  so  long  established
there  that,  as  in  the  case  of  the  linen  webs  of  North
Germany,  the  origin  of  the  craft  is  lost  in  the  obscurity  of
almost  pre-historic  times.  But,  notwithstanding  the  good
quality  of  the  yarn,  the  woollen  stuffs  manufactured  in
those  countries  were  decidedly  coarse,  sent  to  market
undressed,  badly-finished,  and  dyed  in  very  ugly  and
evanescent  colours.  Accordingly  the  Florentine  mer-
chants conceived  the  idea  of  importing  these  foreign  stuffs
in  order  to  dress  and  dye  them  in  their  own  workshops.
Hence  the  origin  of  the  Calimala  or  Calimara  craft. '
Bales  of  cloth  began  to  arrive  from  Flanders,  Holland,
and  Brabant,  and  these  so-called  Prankish  or  ultramontane

•  We  have  already  mentioned  the  probable  derivation  of  this  term.


THE  CALIMALA  AND  WOOL  GUILDS.         317

stuffs  were  carded,  shaved,  dressed,  and  cut  in  Florence.
This  treatment  removed  all  the  knots  coarsening  the  surface,
and  as  the  material  was  much  finer  than  Italian  wool  it  could
be  easily  dyed  in  very  delicate  tints,  and  the  Florentines
soon  surpassed  all  competitors  in  this  particular  art.  Then,
after  being  carefully  ironed,  faced,  and  folded,  the  cloth
was  re-sold  in  a  very  different  condition  and  at  a  much
higher  price.  From  the  first  there  was  a  great  demand
for  these  goods  in  Italy,  and  they  were  afterwards  sent  to
the  East,  and  bartered  for  drugs,  dyes,  and  other  Asiatic
products.  Finally,  as  their  quality  went  on  improving,
they  found  their  way  to  France,  England,  and  the  same
markets  whence  they  had  originally  come,  and  where  they
were  sold  in  exchange  for  undressed  fabrics.  Thus  the
lack  of  original  material  was  not  only  supplied,  but
foreign  manufactures  served  to  swell  Florentine  gains.
A  very  extensive  trade  was  carried  on  with  comparatively
little  trouble,  and  as  the  process  of  wool-dressing  gave
employment  to  many  hands,  the  Calimala  Guild  attained
a  position  of  great  influence  that  was  naturally  shared
by  the  Guild  of  Wool.^

In  fact,  the  latter  being  stirred  by  emulation  and  greed
for  profit,  used  the  utmost  care  to  improve  its  manu-
factures. And  the  development  of  the  craft  was  equally
assisted  by  the  labours  of  private  individuals  and  the  wise
measures  decreed  by  the  State,  At  that  time  there  was
a  monastic  order  in  Italy  known  as  the  Humble  Friars,
originally  founded  by  a  few  Lombard  exiles,  who,  on
being  banished  to  North  Germany  in  10 14  by  Henry  L,
had  learnt  the  very  ancient  craft  of  wool-weaving  practised
there.  Later  on,  having  formed  a  pious  association,  the
exiles  laboured  at  the  trade  for  their  bread,  and  after  five
years'  absence  returned  home  a  united  band  of  workers.
Down  to  the  year  1140  they  remained  laymen,  but  then

'  Vide  Pagnini,  "  Delia  Decima,"  vol.  ii,  sec.  4  and  5.


3i8  THE  GREATER  GUILDS.

decided  to  form  a  religious  order,  afterwards  sanctioned
by  Pope  Innocent  III.  Once  admitted  to  the  priesthood,
they  no  longer  worked  with  their  own  hands,  but  retained
the  management  of  the  business,  had  it  carried  on  by  lay-
men under  the  direction  of  a  mercatore^  and  continually
introduced  new  improvements.  It  was  natural  that  culti-
vated men,  with  members  of  their  order  scattered  over
various  provinces,  should  be  able  to  forward  the  progress
of  the  trade  they  had  founded.  In  fact,  they  acquired  so
much  celebrity  for  their  administrative  talents  that  we  find
them  engaged  at  Florence  and  elsewhere  as  treasurers  of
the  public  revenue  (camarlinghi)  and  as  army  contractors
in  time  of  war.  Wherever  a  house  of  their  order  was
established  the  wool-weaving  craft  immediately  made
advance.  Hence,  with  its  usual  sharpsighted  wisdom
touching  all  questions  of  trade  and  commerce,  the  Floren-
tine Republic,  considering  the  houses  of  the  Umiliati  to  be
great  industrial  schools,  invited  the  friars  to  establish  a
branch  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Florence.

Accordingly  in  1239  the  Humble  Brethren  arrived  and
settled  near  the  city  in  the  Church  of  San  Donato  a  Torri,
granted  to  them  by  the  State.  Their  presence  led  to  the
expected  result.  Before  long  their  house  became  one  of
the  principal  centres  of  Florentine  industry,  so  that  the
guild-masters  complained  of  the  friars'  distance  from  the
town,  and  urged  them  to  move  their  establishment  nearer
to  the  walls.  In  1250  they  obtained  buildings  and  land
in  the  suburb  of  Sta  Lucia  sul  Prato,  and  exemption  from
all  taxes  on  their  property,  the  which  privilege  was  usually
accorded  by  the  Florentines  to  any  one  introducing  a  new
branch  of  trade  in  the  city.  Then,  in  1256,  the  Umiliati
founded  the  church  and  monastery  of  Sta  Caterina,  in
Borgo  Ognissanti,  and  carved  their  arms  over  the  entrance,
/'.<?.,  a  wool-pack  fastened  crosswise  by  ropes.  From  that
moment   the    wool    craft    made    enormous    advance    in


PROSPERITY  OF  THE  WOOL  TRADE.  319

Florence,  and  in  every  European  market  Florentine  cloths
began  to  rank  above  all  others.  Efforts  were  made  to
improve  the  rough  material  and  to  use  additional  care  in
dressing  it,  finer  wools  being  imported  from  Tunis,
Barbary,  Spain,  Portugal,  Flanders,  and  lastly  even  from
England.  Thus  so  vast  a  trade  was  established,  such
great  wealth  accumulated,  that  the  wool  craft  rivalled
and  surpassed  the  Calimala  itself.  Both  guilds  became
great  commercial  powers  in  Europe,  while  in  Florence  the
government  dared  not  oppose  their  decisions.  ^

Giovanni  Villani  informs  us,  in  his  valuable  account  of
Florentine  statistics  during  the  year  1338,  that  there  were
more  than  two  hundred  wool  factories,  turning  out  from
seventy  thousand  to  eighty  thousand  pieces  of  cloth,  of
the  total  value  of  one  million  two  hundred  thousand
florins,  "  of  the  which  sum  a  good  third  was  kept  at  home
for  the  works,  without  counting  the  earnings  of  the  wool
dressers  in  the  said  works,  the  which  supplied  a  living  to
over  thirty  thousand  persons."  The  chief  profits  of  the
trade  were  obtained  by  perfection  of  manufacture,  rather
than  by  any  increase  of  produce.  Even  Villani  remarked
that  thirty  years  earlier,  that  is,  in  1308,  the  factories  were
more  numerous,  actually  as  many  as  three  hundred,  and
producing  one  hundred  thousand  pieces  of  cloth  :  "  but
these  stuffs  were  coarser,  and  of  only  half  the  value,
having  no  intermixture  of  English  wool,  the  which  indeed
they  had  not  yet  learnt  to  dress  with  the  skill  since
acquired."  *  This  clearly  shows  that  the  craft  owed  its
first  improvement  in  the  thirteenth  century  to  the
Humble  Friars,  and  was  carried  to  perfection  in  the
fifteenth  century  by  the  introduction  of  English  woollens.

In  the  same  year  of  1338  the  Calimala  Guild  owned
twenty  warehouses  in  Florence,  '*  yearly  receiving  more
than  ten  thousand  pieces  of  cloth,  to  the  value  of  three

320  THE  GREATER  GUILDS.

hundred  thousand  florins,  all  sold  in  Florence,  and  with-
out including  those  sent  out  of  the  city."  ^  The  Calimala
craftsmen  were  exceedingly  skilled  as  refiners  and  dyers,
and  particularly  successful  in  preparing  the  crimson  cloth
for  which  there  was  a  great  demand  in  Florence,  as  it  was
used  for  the  lucco^  a  hooded  robe  worn  by  all  citizens
entitled  to  enter  the  Public  Palace  and  sit  in  the  tribunals
or  councils  of  the  Republic.  The  two  guilds  afterwards
made  a  division  of  labour  in  order  to  avoid  infringing
each  other's  rights.  The  statutes  absolutely  prohibited
the  Calimala  from  dying  anything  save  foreign  stuffs,  and
the  Woollen  Guild  had  dyers  of  its  own,  forming,  as  it
were,  a  subordinate  association.  These  dyers  were  bound
to  deposit  three  hundred  florins  with  the  guild  as  a
warranty,  and  fines  were  deducted  from  this  sum  when-
ever the  goods  delivered  were  soiled  or  dyed  a  bad
colour.  The  officers  of  the  guilds  were  exceedingly
severe  on  these  points.  Every  inch  of  cloth  underwent
the  minutest  examination,  and  the  least  defect  in  colour,
quality,  or  measure  exposed  the  workman  to  heavy
penalties.  Some  of  these  great  Florentine  guilds  were
not  composed  solely  of  one  trade,  but  were  often
agglomerations  of  various  crafts,  particularly  in  the  case
of  the  Wool  Guild,  which  included  many  kinds  of  work-
men, ranging  from  carders  of  the  rough  material  to  dyers
and  finers  of  the  most  costly  fabrics.  Thus,  the  guild
being  able  to  carry  on  the  manufacture  in  all  its  details,
and  the  different  craftsmen  required  for  the  common  end
being  all  bonded  together,  there  was  no  fear  that  any  one
branch  of  the  trade  would  raise  its  prices  to  the  detriment
of  the  rest.  The  emblem  of  the  Wool  Guild  was  a  lamb
bearing  a  flag  {Agnus  Dei)y  while  the  Calimala  showed  a
red  eagle  on  a  white  bale  corded  with  many  twists.

During  the  whole  of  the  fourteenth  and  a  considerable

FOREIGN  COMPETITION.  321

part  of  the  fifteenth  century  these  two  guilds  continued  to
progress,  and  maintained  their  supremacy  in  the  markets
of  Europe.  Nevertheless,  they  were  always  in  a  difficult
position,  since  Italy  could  not  supply  them  with  sufficient
raw  material,  nor  could  they  obtain  the  number  of
hands  required  to  carry  on  all  the  work  connected  with
their  business.  To  establish  branches  of  the  trade  in
neighbouring  states  and  subject  cities  was  an  idea  that
found  no  place  in  the  economic  and  political  theories  of
the  Middle  Ages.  In  those  days  trade  formed  the  chief
strength  and  social  power  of  the  communes  :  hence  every
commune  wished  to  have  the  monopoly  of  its  advantages,
and  the  statutes  bristled  with  decrees  inspired  by  this
blindly  jealous  exclusiveness.  For  this  reason,  while
pursuing  the  system  of  keeping  the  finer  and  more  profit-
able processes  of  the  manufacture  in  their  own  hands,  the
Florentines  had  opened  factories  for  the  first  and  coarser
stages  of  the  work  in  every  place  where  the  best  wool  could
be  found,  that  is  in  Holland,  Brabant,  England,  and  France.
And  even  in  these  factories  they  took  care  that  the  more
difficult  and  profitable  share  of  the  process  should  be
done  only  by  Florentine  hands.  Their  chronicles  prove
that  they  then  spoke  of  foreigners  in  the  same  terms  now
used  by  the  latter  with  regard  to  ourselves  :  jeering  at
the  indolence  and  stupidity  of  the  northerners,  who  even
on  their  own  soil  allowed  strangers  to  snatch  the  bread  from
their  mouths.  But  this  state  of  things  could  not  last  long.
From  very  early  times  the  Flemings  had  always  been  a
strong,  hard-working  race,  and  were  very  soon  equalled  '
by  the  French  and  English.  So  gradually  the  eyes  of  the
northerners  were  opened,  and  the  Florentines  saw  new
factories  rising  abroad,  side  by  side  with  and  soon  rival-
ling their  own,  and  were  obliged  to  admit  that,  to  their
own  despite,  they  had  taught  foreigners  the  very  trade  of
which  they  had  meant  to  preserve  the  monopoly.     Nor

was  this  the  end  of  the  matter.  Being  now  on  the  alert,
the  northerners  tried  to  check  the  exportation  of  their
wools  and  of  their  uncut,  or  rather  undressed,  cloths  ;  and
from  the  end  of  the  fifteenth  century  Henry  VII.  of
England  began  to  take  measures  to  that  effect.  Thence-
forth the  Guilds  of  Wool  and  Calimala  were  doomed  to
decline  in  Florence.  Fortunately,  however,  before  this
came  about,  the  silk  trade  had  assumed  the  same  im-
portance in  Florentine  commerce  that  was  gradually
slipping  away  from  the  other  two  crafts.

As  every  one  is  aware,  the  art  of  silk-weaving,  though
of  very  early  origin  in  the  East,  was  only  introduced
much  later  to  the  Western  world.  The  Romans  obtained
a  few  silk  stuffs  from  Persia,  India,  and  China  at  an
enormous  expense  ;  they  also  had  certain  insects  from
which  material  for  highly  esteemed  fabrics  was  procured  ;
but  until  the  closing  years  of  the  Middle  Ages  the  real
silkworm  was  unknown  in  Italy,  and  the  details  of  its  first
introduction  in  the  West  have  not  yet  been  fully  ascer-
tained. It  is  related  that  during  the  sixth  century  B.C.
two  Persian  monks  concealed  some  silkworm  seed  inside
their  staffs,  and  thus  succeeded  in  bearing  it  to  Constanti-
nople, where  they  taught  the  art  of  rearing  the  insects.
In  this  wise  the  silk  trade  is  supposed  to  have  been
originated  in  the  dominions  of  the  Byzantine  Empire,  and
carried  thence  by  Arabs  and  Mahomedans  to  Sicily  and
Greece.  When  Roger  II.,  Count  of  Sicily,  conquered
the  Ionian  islands,  he  returned  to  Palermo  with
numerous  prisoners  (1147-48),  who  greatly  assisted
the  progress  of  the  silk  trade  there.  Thence  it  easily
penetrated  to  Lombardy  and  Tuscany  ;  but  was  first
established  and  perfected  in  Lucca,  all  the  Florentines
being  still   devoted  to  the  profitable  wool  trade.

The  consuls  of  the  Silk  Guild — or  of  Por'  Santa  Maria,
as  it  was  designated  in  Florence,  from  the  name  of  its


PROGRESS  OF  THE  SILK  TRADE.  323

street — are  mentioned  among  other  guild-masters  in
public  treaties  ;  but  although  this  craft  too  may  be  of
ancient  date,  it  certainly  began  to  flourish  much  later
than  the  rest.  Noting  the  fact  that  Giovanni  Villani
makes  no  allusion  to  the  Silk  Guild  in  his  very  minute
account  of  Florentine  trade  and  commerce  in  1338,  we
are  inclined  to  believe  that  it  had  made  very  little  ad-
vance at  that  period.^

We  know  that  when  Uguccioni  della  Faggiola  besieged
and  took  Lucca  (13 14),  fiigitives  from  that  city  brought
their  improved  method  of  silk-weaving  to  Lombardy,
Venice,  and  Tuscany,  and  the  art  being  particularly
undeveloped  in  Florence,  many  chroniclers  gave  the
Lucchese  the  credit  of  having  first  introduced  it  there.
Nevertheless,  for  many  years  afterwards  the  silk  trade
was  carried  on  by  importing  the  raw  material  from  the
East.  But  as  the  wool  craft  began  to  decline,  Florence
gave  its  whole  attention  to  silk,  and  the  trade  speedily  be-
gan to  prosper.  In  the  early  years  of  the  fifteenth  century,
Gino  Capponi — he  who  was  commissary  to  the  camp  at
the  siege  of  Pisa — taught  the  Florentines  the  art  of
spinning  the  gold  thread  they  had  hitherto  imported  from
Cologne  or  from  Cyprus  to  interweave  with  their  silk.
This  was  the  beginning  of  that  delicate  manufacture  of
gold  and  silver  brocades,  in  which  by  the  combination  of
technical  skill  with  artistic  sense,  the  Florentines  soon
surpassed  all  rival  manufacturers.  The  markets  from
which  their  woollen  stuffs  had  been  ousted,  were  speedily
reconquered  by  their  silken  cloths  and  brocades.  During
the  latter  half  of  the  fifteenth  century,  in  fact,  we  find

'  It  would  seem  that  the  Guild  of  Por'  Santa  Maria  originally  traded
in  Florentine  woollen  stuffs,  and  that  the  silk  merchants  formed  a
secondary  and  separate  branch.  Gradually,  however,  they  became
amalgamated  with  the  guild  (early  in  the  thirteenth  century),  and  then
became  its  principal  components,  until  at  last  the  Silk  Guild  and  Por'
Santa  Maria  were  entirely  fused  in  one.


394  THE  GREATER  GUILDS.

Benedetto  Dei,  a  merchant  of  the  Bardi  Company,  writing
a  letter  to  Venice  praising  the  glory  and  greatness  of
Florentine  commerce  and  saying  :  "  We  have  two  crafts
worthier  and  greater  than  any  four  contained  in  your  city
of  Venice."  And  the  gist  of  his  subsequent  remarks  was
to  this  effect  :  "  Our  woollen  stuffs  go  to  Rome,  Naples,
Sicily,  the  Morea,  Constantinople,  Broussa,  Pera,  Gallipoli,
Schio,  Rhodes,  and  Salonica,  Then,  as  to  the  silk  and
gold  brocades,  we  produce  more  than  Venice,  Genoa,  and
Lucca  combined,  and  you  see  that  we  have  houses,  banks,
and  warehouses  at  Lyons,  Bruges,  London,  Antwerp,
Avignon,  Geneva,  Marseilles,  and  in  Provence. "^  This
long  list  of  cities  plainly  shows  that  in  Dei's  time  Floren-
tine woollens,  though  still  prized  in  the  East,  had  been
driven  from  the  principal  markets  of  the  West,  and
replaced  by  silk  stuffs  ;  and  thus  the  two  guilds  shared
commerce  between  them,  one  in  the  East,  the  other  in  the
West.  Also,  according  to  Dei,  Florence  then  possessed
eighty-three  factories,  where  various  tissues  of  silk,  gold,
and  silver  were  produced  known  by  the  names  of  damasks,
velvets,  satins,  taffetas,  and  maremmatiy  and  most  of  the
raw  silk  used  in  their  fabrication  was  still  imported  from
the  East  by  Florentine  galleys.^

This  is  one  of  the  trades  longest  preserved  in  Florence
and  other  parts  of  Italy,  and  to  this  day  silk  is  among  the
most  important  of  our  products.  With  this  difference,
however,  that  whereas  in  past  times  the  weaving  of  the
silk  was  our  chief  source  of  profit,  at  present  we
frequently  export  the  raw  material,  repurchasing  at  an
enormously  increased  price  the  fabrics  returned  to  us
from  foreign  looms.     In  old  times  we  imported  woollen

Pagnini's  "  Decima."

and  silk  yarn,  and  exported  Italian  cloth  and  brocade  ;  in
these  days,  on  the  contrary,  we  send  no  small  portion  of
our  raw  silk  to  Lyons,  and  receive  it  back  in  a  manu-
factured state.  In  the  same  way  other  raw  materials,
which  we  might  easily  work  up  ourselves,  are  despatched
to  foreign  factories.

III.

There  was  one  branch  of  industry,  however,  almost
solely  the  product  of  human  talent  and  energy,  in  which
the  Florentines  stood  positively  first.  From  the  opening
of  the  thirteenth  to  the  end  of  the  fifteenth  century  the
money-changers'  craft  was  an  essentially  Florentine  busi-
ness. For  as  soon  as  the  merchants  had  established  com-
mercial relations  with  all  the  markets  of  the  East  and  the
West,  they  naturally  put  into  circulation  a  large  quantity
of  specie.  Therefore  it  naturally  ensued  that  if  any
trader  of  Antwerp  or  Bruges  wished  to  forward  money  to
Italy  or  Constantinople,  the  easiest  and  safest  plan  was  to
apply  to  some  of  the  Florentine  merchants  in  his  own
town.  The  latter  bought  up  the  wool  and  rough  cloths,
which,  after  being  dressed  in  Florence,  either  returned  to
Northern  Europe,  or  found  their  way  to  Constantinople,
CafFa,  or  Tana  (Azov),  in  exchange  for  silks,  dyes,  and
spices.  Accordingly  the  transmittal  of  any  sum  to  any
part  of  the  then  known  world  cost  them  little  more
trouble  than  the  despatch  of  an  ordinary  letter,  and  was
always  a  source  of  gain.  For  they  received  agio  on  their
money,  and  by  sending  it  in  the  form  of  merchandise,
reaped  a  second  profit.  When,  on  the  contrary,  any
Florentine  wished  to  send  a  hundred  florins  to  London,
he  had  only  to  walk  a  few  steps  to  find  some  merchant
of  the  Calimala  or  Por'  Santa  Maria,  who,  by  a  line  to  his
correspondent  in  Lombard  Street,  caused  the  payment  to


326  THE  GREATER  GUILDS.

be  made.  These  so-called  letters  of  exchange  [lettere  di
cambio)  proved  one  of  the  most  useful  of  inventions  for
the  advancement  of  modern  trade.  There  has  been
much  discussion  as  to  whom  this  discovery  was
originally  owed.  Some  attribute  it  to  the  fugitive,
persecuted  Jews  in  France  and  England  ;  while  others
ascribe  it,  at  a  much  later  date,  to  the  Guelphs
banished  from  Florence  in  the  thirteenth  century.  But
it  is  very  difficult  to  ascertain  who  was  the  first  author  of
what  cannot  be  justly  styled  a  discovery,  seeing  that  it  is
an  arrangement  so  readily  occurring  to  the  mind,  that
examples  of  it  are  even  to  be  found  in  very  remote
antiquity.  Besides,  the  real  importance  of  the  letter  of
exchange  consists  not  in  its  invention,  but  in  its  legally
authorised  value,  its  extensive  use,  and  the  thousand
different  ways  in  which  it  may  be  turned  to  account  for
the  speedy  transmission  and  increase  of  capital.  On  these
points  the  Florentines  of  the  period  were  altogether
unforestalled  and  unsurpassed,  being  superior  masters
of  the  art  of  finance.

When  the  exiled  Guelphs  went  wandering  about  the
world  in  the  thirteenth  century  they  strengthened  the  wide-
spreading  commercial  ties  established  by  Florence,  and
founding  banks  in  all  parts,  gave  a  tremendous  impulse
to  the  money-changers'  trade.  Accordingly  they  were
credited  with  the  invention  of  the  "  letters  of  exchange,"
which  now  being  widely  circulated,  gained  added  im-
portance. In  fact,  all  subtle  and  ingenious  devices  for
multiplying  gold,  by  despatching  it  to  every  market  where,
being  scarce,  it  consequently  commanded  the  highest  price
and  interest,  and  almost  all  the  complicated  and  difficult
operations  practised  by  our  modern  bankers,  were  already
familiar  to  the  Florentines.  Whenever  the  Republic  was
obliged  to  borrow  money  it  obtained  loans  from  the
bankers   of  Florence   on  precisely  the  same  system  and


I


BANKING  OPERATIONS.  327

method  in  use  at  this  day,  no  source  of  profit  being
unknown  to  those  financiers.  Also,  when  the  total  of
these  loans  was  formed  into  the  so-called  Monte  Comune,
paying  interest  on  the  consohdated  capital,  the  luoghi  del
Monte^  which  would  nowadays  go  by  the  name  of  "  shares
of  the  public  debt,"  were  negotiated  precisely  as  at
present.  We  find  the  Florentine  merchants  under  the
Arcades  of  the  New  Market,  speculating  on  the  rise  and
fall  of  stock,  like  modern  men  on  "  'Change  "  in  great
capitals.  I  And  the  profits  of  similar  ventures  were  far
greater  at  a  time  when  lawfiil  interest  varied  between  10
and  20  per  cent.,  and  few  felt  any  scruples  against
carrying  it  up  to  40  per  cent,  by  means  of  fictitious
contracts.  For  instance,  the  lenders  would  fix  an  im-
possibly early  date  for  the  receipt  of  the  lawflil  interest,
and  after  that  date  took  40  per  cent,  with  the  pretext
that  the  extra  amount  was  the  fine  agreed  upon  in  case
of  non-payment.

It  should  be  kept  in  mind  that  the  Florentines  reaped
great  advantages  in  all  these  banking  operations  from  the
excellent  quality  of  their  coinage,  for  the  Republican  Mint
always  kept  the  best  interests  of  commerce  in  view.  To
this  end,  in  the  year  1252,  the  gold  florin  of  twenty  carats
was  struck,  with  the  figure  of  St.  John  on  one  side  and  the
lily  of  Florence  on  the  reverse  ;  and,  owing  to  the  good-
ness of  the  metal  and  its  alloy,  soon  obtained  currency

*  "  Again,  a  law  was  passed  in  1371,  inasmuch  as  many  men  traded
the  shares  of  the  Monte  in  this  wise  :  One  said  to  another:  'the  shares
of  the  Monte  are  at  thirty  ;  I  wish  to  do  some  business  with  you  to-day.
This  time  next  year  I'll  sell  to  you,  or  you  to  me,  at  what  price  shall  we
say  ? '  At  thirty-one  the  share  [of  one  hundred]  ?  '  What  premium  do  you
ask  for  this  ? '  So  they  bargained,  and  the  terms  were  fixed.  When
shares  fell,  the  merchant  bought,  if  they  rose,  he  sold  out,  and  the
stock  changed  hands  twenty  times  in  the  year.  Accordingly  a  tax  was
charged  of  two  florins  in  the  hundred  for  every  transfer.''  Marchionne
di  Coppo  Stefani,  vol.  viii.  p.  97,  in  the  "  Delizie  degli  Eruditi  Toscani,"

in  every  Eastern  as  well  as  European  market.  Eight  of
these  florins  weighed  one  ounce,  and  a  single  florin  was
valued  at  about  twelve  Italian  lire.  The  Florentines,
however,  usually  made  their  calculations  in  Ure^  soldi^  and
denari.  The  silver  lira^  then  the  conventional  standard,
consisted  of  twenty  soldi^  and  the  soldo  of  twelve  denari.
The  florin  seldom  altered  in  value,  but  the  lira^  either
from  the  greater  variability  in  the  price  of  silver,  or  from
other  causes,  was  constantly  altering  its  rate  with  regard
to  the  florin.  In  1252  the  latter  was  equivalent  to  the
lira.,  and  therefore  similarly  divided  into  twenty  soldi ;
in  1282  it  already  consisted  of  thirty-two  soldi ;  m  1331,
of  sixty  soldi,  or  three  lirey  and  always  changing  in  value,
rose  to  four  lire^  eight  soldi  by  the  year  1464.

The  Florentines  had  discerned  how  greatly  their  com-
merce was  benefited  by  the  use  of  a  coin  universally  prized
in  all  markets  supplied  with  their  goods.  But  in  the
beginning  of  the  fifteenth  century,  when  their  trade
penetrated  farther  into  the  East,  they  found  themselves
forestalled  by  the  Venetians,  whose  gold  ducat,  somewhat
larger  and  heavier  than  the  florin,  was  already  current
there.  Accordingly,  in  1422,  they  decreed  the  issue  of
another  florin,  equivalent  to  the  Venetian  ducat  in  weight,
size,  and  value,  and  therefore  easily  exchanged  for  it.
And  as  this  new  and  larger  florin  was  to  be  carried  to  the
Levant  on  board-ship,  they  named  it  the  "  broad  florin,"
or  the  "galley  florin,"  to  distinguish  it  from  the  older
'*  sealed  florin  "  (Jjorino  di  suggello).  In  1471  the  older
coin  only  was  re-issued,  and  kept  in  circulation  down  to
1530,  when  it  was  held  equivalent  to*  seven  lire,  and  was
then  withdrawn  for  a  time.^  Thus  we  see  that  for  a
considerable  period  two  difi^erent  florins  were  in  use,  that
the  lira  altered  in  value  from  one  year  to  another  ;  and

PROSPERITY  OF  THE  FLORENTINE  BANKERS.     329

if  we  likewise  remember  that  economists  are  still  unagreed
as  to  the  exact  difference  between  the  present  value  of
gold  and  silver  and  their  value  in  the  days  of  the
Republic,  we  shall  recognise  the  difficulty  of  making  any
calculation  sufficiently  exact  to  afford  any  precise  idea  of
the  relative  prices  of  things.  It  is  asserted  by  some
writers  that  a  given  quantity  of  gold  was  only  worth  in
those  days  double  its  present  value  ;  while  others  exagge-
rated its  value  to  fortyfold.  Sismondi  believes  that  in
the  fourteenth  and  fifteenth  centuries  gold  must  have  been
worth  four  times  as  much  as  at  present.  Certainly  the
florin,  or  zechin^  as  it  was  called  later,  is  worth  about
twelve  Italian  lire.  But  the  difference  in  the  value  of
gold  remains  involved  in  uncertainty.  Besides,  when  old
writers  reckon  by  lire^  it  is  needful  to  remember  that  these
coins  varied  in  value  ;  that  it  is  impossible  to  make  even
an  approximative  calculation  without  knowing  the  exact
date  referred  to.

Returning  to  the  Guild  of  Changers,  we  must  again
insist  on  the  point  that,  in  addition  to  the  extended  com-
mercial relations,  the  wise  measures  enforced  by  the
Republic  and  the  singular  activity  of  the  citizens,  the
rapid  prosperity  of  the  Florentine  bankers  was  also  greatly
enhanced  by  their  nearness  to  Rome.  The  revenues  of  the
Holy  See  and  of  its  prelates  in  all  parts  of  Christendom
were  all  poured  into  the  Eternal  City.  There  gathered
the  spiritual  lords,  bishops,  and  cardinals,  holding  rich
benefices  in  the  East  or  the  West ;  thither  from  all  the
remotest  ends  of  the  known  world  believers  sent  sums  of
"  St.  Peter's  pence,"  together  with  the  costly  offerings
suited  to  a  period  of  religious  faith  and  fanaticism.  The
keen-witted  Florentines  quickly  recognised  the  advantage
of  becoming  bankers  to  the  Pope  ;  for  thus  the  largest
floating  capital  in  the  world  would  have  to  pass  through
their  hands.     So,  from  the  first,  they  used  the  most  per-


330  THE  GREATER  GUILDS.

sistent  efforts  to  obtain  that  position.  If  we  find  them
clinging  to  the  Guelph  cause  through  all  changes  of  time
and  circumstance,  and  preserving  the  name  of  Guelphs,
even  when  the  term  had  lost  all  meaning,  we  must
attribute  no  little  weight  to  commercial  as  well  as  to
political  motives.  Placed  in  the  centre  of  Italy,  and  not
far  from  Rome,  they  had  to  struggle  chiefly  against  the
Siennese,  who  were  still  nearer  to  the  Eternal  City.  For
this  reason  we  soon  find  them  engaged  in  warfare  and
jealous  strife  with  Sienna,  the  which  republic  was  subse-
quently worsted,  not  only  in  fight,  but  also  by  the  wider-
stretching  enterprise  of  Florentine  commerce.  It  is  proved
by  the  correspondence  of  Gregory  IX.  that  even  in  1233
the  Tuscans  were  forwarding  remittances  to  the  Pope
from  various  parts  of  the  world  ;  and  gradually  the
monopoly  of  this  business  became  more  exclusively  con-
centrated in  Florentine  hands.  When  the  Pontifical  Seat
was  transferred  from  Rome  to  Avignon  (1305),  and  on  its
restoration  later  to  Rome  again,  there  occurred,  twice  at
least,  an  enormous  displacement  of  interest,  a  great  move-
ment of  capital,  and  a  necessity  for  large  remittances  in
cash  ;  and,  according  to  the  best  authorities,  this  was  the
favourable  moment  when  the  Florentine  contractors  of  the
Papal  revenues  were  enabled  to  become  the  principal
bankers  of  Rome.  From  that  time  their  fortune  was
assured,  the  greatest  banking  business  in  Europe  passed
through  their  hands,  and  they  rose  to  so  high  a  repute,
that  all  sought  their  help  and  advice  on  matters  of  finance.
We  see  the  Florentines  Invited  to  manage  the  mints,
and  fix  the  weights  and  measures  of  various  European
states.  In  1278  a  convention  between  the  King  of
France  and  the  Lombard  and  Tuscan  Universitates  invites
both  to  find  money  for  the  former's  government.  In
1 306  the  Modenese  people  issued  a  decree,  appealing  for
the  same  purpose,  to  the  notaries  and  bankers  of  Florence.


THE  ENGLISH  CROWN  SAVED.  331

Then  in  1302,  when  the  King  of  France,  lacking  funds
wherewith  to  make  war,  decided  on  repeated  debasement
of  the  coinage,  this  fatal  step  was  attributed  to  the
advice  of  two  Florentines,  Bicci  and  Musciatto  Franzesi.
These  men  were  severely  censured  by  their  fellow-citizens,
many  of  whom  had  been  ruined  by  the  bad  French  cur-
rency. On  all  occasions  when  the  French  sovereigns  were
on  the  eve  of  a  great  war,  they  were  practically  compelled
to  first  secure  the  aid  of  some  known  Florentine  banker
in  bearing  the  expense.  Some  of  these  bankers  held  the
same  position  in  Europe  as  the  Rothschilds  of  the  present
day,  and  accumulated  fortunes  of  apparently  fabulous
amounts.  In  1260  the  Salimbeni  house  lent  twenty
thousand  florins  to  the  Siennese.  In  1338  we  find  the
Bardi  and  Peruzzi  creditors  of  King  Edward  III.  of
England  for  one  million  three  hundred  and  sixty-five
florins,  the  which,  without  reckoning  the  difference  in  the
value  of  gold,  would  amount  to  about  sixteen  millions  of
Italian  lire ;  and  allowing  for  that  difference,  would
amount,  as  Sismondi  has  calculated,  to  no  less  than  sixty-
four  millions.  Pagnini  adds  a  list  of  many  other  loans,
amounting  to  a  positively  enormous  total.  In  1321
the  Peruzzi  had  a  credit  of  191,000  florins  on  the
Order  of  Jerusalem  alone,  and  the  Bardi  another  of
133,000  florins.  In  1348  the  house  of  Tommaso  di
Carroccio  degli  Alberti  and  his  kinsmen  had  banks  at
Avignon,  Brussells,  Paris,  Sienna,  Perugia,  Rome,  Naples,
Barletta,  Constantinople,  and  Venice.  ^  And  at  the  close  of
the  fifteenth  century  Philippe  de  Commines  declared  that
Edward  IV.  of  England  owed  his  crown  to  the  help  of
Florentine  bankers.

332  THE  GREATER  GUILDS.

Florence,  its  consuls  being  named  on  the  same  footing  as
the  rest  in  all  public  records  ;  and  a  copy  of  its  statutes,
dated  1299  (1300  new  style),  makes  reference  to  an  earlier
code  of  1280,  that  was  not  the  earliest  of  all.  This  craft
prospered  and  waned  with  the  commerce  of  Florence.  It
was  carried  on  in  the  New  Market,  where  it  had  shops  with
counters  or  tavoletti^  money-bags,  and  ledgers.  All  busi-
ness had  to  be  performed  in  the  shop,  and  registered  in
the  account  book,  and  heavy  penalties  were  exacted  for
any  infringement  of  the  rule  ;  nor  was  any  one  allowed
to  exercise  the  craft  without  being  inscribed  on  the  matri-
culation list,  a  privilege  only  to  be  obtained  by  having
given  proofs  of  capacity  and  honesty  during  matriculation,
and  sworn  to  obey  the  statutes  of  the  guild.  In  1338
there  were  about  eighty  of  these  money-changers'  stalls,
and  Florence  coined  from  350,000  to  400,000  gold
florins.^  In  1422  these  stalls  numbered  seventy-two,
while  it  was  calculated  that  Florence  had  a  capital  of  two
million  florins  in  circulation,  without  including  the  value
of  the  merchandise  in  the  city.2  In  1472,  partly  because
the  first  signs  of  the  decline  of  trade  were  appearing,  and
partly  because  trade  was  becoming  restricted  to  a  more
and  more  limited  number  of  firms,  the  banks  were  already
reduced  to  thirty-three, 3  although  the  chronicler  Benedetto
Dei  still  remarked  with  pride  that  these  bankers  did  busi-
ness in  the  East  and  the  West,  "  as  is  well  known  to  the
Venetians  and  Genoese,  and  likewise  to  the  Court  of
Rome."  4  They  were  everywhere  known  by  the  names
of  changers,  lenders,  usurers,  Tuscans,  and  Lombards,  and,
together  with  other  Italian  houses,  had  a  street  of  their
own  both  in  London  and  Paris.

OTHER  FLORENTIJSIE  GUILDS.  333


IV.

In  order  to  complete  the  list  of  the  greater  guilds,
we  must  say  a  few  words  concerning  the  Doctors  and
Druggists,  and  Skinners  and  Furriers,  and  particularly  the
former.  Although  of  less  importance  commercially  than
the  guilds  already  described,  they  had  a  great  share  in
promoting  Florentine  trade  in  the  Levant,  whence  nearly
all  drugs  and  spices  were  received  in  exchange,  and  no
less  than  twenty-two  different  qualities  of  fur,  many  of
which,  being  the  skins  of  rare  animals,  formed  some
of  the  dearest  articles  of  luxury.  Therefore  these  two
guilds  likewise  rose  to  great  influence,  inasmuch  as  the
Eastern  trade  has  invariably  proved  the  main  source  of
wealth  for  all  nations,  and  most  of  all  for  Italy.  It
served  to  sustain  the  high  fortunes  of  Venice  ;  it  had
enriched  Amalfi,  Genoa,  and  Pisa ;  and  accordingly  was
constantly  coveted  by  the  Florentines,  whose  highest
prosperity  indeed  was  only  attained  when  the  Black  Sea
being  opened  to  their  galleys,  they  could  enjoy  the  same
rights  as  the  Venetians  in  Egypt,  Constantinople,  and
the  Crimea.  This,  so  long  their  principal  aim,  was
not,  however,  quickly  attained  :  they  continued  to
wrestle  for  it  throughout  almost  the  whole  of  the
fourteenth  century.

The  struggles  maintained  by  the  Florentines  for  the
extension  of  their  trade  play  a  very  important  part  in
the  history  of  the  Republic,  not  only  demonstrating
the  progress  of  their  wealth,  but  likewise  the  ruling
motives  of  their  policy.  In  fact,  the  moment  they  had
won  their  first  successes  against  the  nobles  of  the  contado
surrounding  them  on  all  sides,  they  immediately  tried  to
monopolise  the  whole  trade  with  Lombardy.  One  of  the
first  treaties  signed  by  them  was  with  the  Ubaldini,  lords


334  THE  GREATER  GUILDS.

of  the  Mugello,  for  the  purpose  of  opening  that  highway
for  their  products  ;  and  shortly  afterwards  they  made  a
treaty  with  the  Bolognese  (1203).  But  in  course  of
time  the  latter,  profiting  by  their  position,  exacted
heavier  tolls  on  the  merchandise  now  continually  passing
through  their  territory  ;  whereupon  the  Florentines
promptly  came  to  terms  with  Modena,  opening  a  fresh
road  for  their  commerce,  and  thus  compelling  Bologna
to  respect  the  original  agreement.  In  1282,  at  the  time
of  the  war  against  Pisa,  they  arranged  treaties  guaran-
teeing free  passage  to  their  merchandise  through  Lucca,
Prato,  Pistoia,  and  Volterra,  and  thus  began  their
domination  over  the  commerce  of  Tuscany.  Nearly  all
their  wars  were  undertaken  for  purposes  of  trade,  and
ended  with  trading  agreements.  In  1390  they  entered
into  conventions  with  Faenza  and  Ravenna,  and  then
step  by  step  with  the  majority  of  the  Italian  cities.

The  continual  increase  of  Florentine  commerce  by
land  made  the  necessity  of  free  access  to  the  sea  ever
more  pressing  and  indispensable.  But  to  reach  either
Porto  Pisano  or  Leghorn,  the  only  ports  convenient  for
their  trade,  they  must  necessarily  traverse  the  republic  of
Pisa,  their  powerful  neighbour  and  rival.  For  if  the
Florentines  were  masters  of  nearly  the  whole  Tuscan
trade  by  land,  the  Pisans  were  lords  of  the  sea,  and  had
no  intention  of  allowing  their  realm  to  be  snatched  from
them  by  so  industrious  and  energetic  a  race  as  their
competing  neighbours,  Accordingly  the  Pisans  had  only
to  demand  heavy  tolls  for  the  passage  of  those  neighbours'
goods,  and  the  Florentines  were  left  with  no  remedy  save
recourse  to  arms.  Hence  the  continual  warfare  and
perpetual  rivalry  of  the  two  republics.  After  the  capture
of  Volterra  by  the  Florentines  in  1254,  the  threatening
attitude  of  their  victorious  troops  drove  the  Pisans  to
grant  free  passage   to  their  merchandise,  and  in   1273,


EXTENSION  OF  TRADE  IN  THE  LEVANT.     335

1293,  1327,  and  1329  similarly  compelled  them  to
adhere  to  the  same  terms.  Pisa,  however,  never  yielded
the  point  with  a  good  grace,  but  merely  to  avoid  war,  or
in  consequence  of  defeat.

Meanwhile  the  Florentines  were  continually  extending
their  trade  to  remoter  parts  of  the  East,  and  concluding
fresh  treaties  there.  This,  while  increasing  their  desire
to  command  the  sea,  fanned  the  jealousy  of  Pisa  to  a
fiercer  flame.  In  Pagnini's  work  on  "  La  Decima  "  we
find  an  essay  on  the  **  Practise  of  Trade "  ("  Pratica
della  Mercatura  "),  written  early  in  the  fourteenth  century
by  an  agent  of  the  Bardi  firm,  one  Balducci  Pegolotti.
Next  to  Marco  Polo's  "  Milione,"  this  work  is  one  of
our  most  important  sources  of  information  regarding
Italian  travels  and  trading  enterprises  in  the  Levant,  and
furnishes  specially  minute  details  of  Florentine  traffic.
From  what  Pegolotti  tells  us  of  his  own  doings,  we  may
judge  what  was  done  by  his  fellow-citizens  in  general.
In  13 1 5  he  succeeded  in  securing  for  them  in  Antwerp
and  Brabant  similar  franchises  to  those  already  enjoyed
by  the  Genoese,  Germans,  and  English.  He  afterwards
went  to  the  Levant,  and  found  at  Cyprus  that  the  Bardi
and  Peruzzi  alone  shared  the  privilege  granted  to  the
Pisans  of  only  paying  1  per  cent,  import  and  export
duty  ;  whereas  all  other  Florentines  had  either  to  pay
4  per  cent.,  or  feign  to  be  Pisans,  a  device  exposing
them  to  many  spitefiil  reprisals  from  the  latter,  who
treated  them  worse  than  slaves  or  Jews.  These  pro-
ceedings aroused  Pegolotti's  wrath,  so  that,  although  he
was  one  of  the  Bardi  firm,  he  made  great  and  successful
efforts  to  have  the  same  privilege  of  franchise  extended
to  the  rest  of  the  Florentines  (1324).  Thus,  their
common  interests  being  promoted  no  less  by  the  energy
of  individuals  than  by  that  of  their  government,  these
merchants  continued  to  make  advance  in  the  East,  and


336  THE  GREATER  GUILDS.

stir  the  Pisans  to  greater  envy.  In  fact,  the  latter  decided
in  1343  to  reduce  the  exemptions  allowed  on  Florentine
merchandise,  decreeing  that  goods  only  to  the  value  of
200,000  florins  might  pass  untaxed  through  their  city  ;
all  the  rest  being  charged  two  soldi  the  lira — i.e.^  at  the
rate  of  10  per  cent.  This  left  the  Florentines  no  choice
save  to  make  war,  or  find  some  mode  of  avoiding  the
Pisan  highway.  To  prove  that  their  trade  was  not
altogether  at  the  mercy  of  Pisa,  they  preferred  the  second
alternative.  By  making  treaty  with  the  Siennese,  they
obtained  the  concession  of  Porto  Talamone,  and  at  great
expense,  and  in  the  teeth  of  many  difficulties,  finally
succeeded  in  making  it  a  vast  emporium  for  their  wares.
The  road  to  Talamone  was  long  and  inconvenient  ;  but
the  Pisans,  soon  perceiving  that  they  had  done  greater
damage  to  themselves  than  to  Florence,  and  that  ahhough
they  might  inflict  annoyance  on  the  latter,  there  was  no
hope  of  destroying  its  trade,  were  therefore  presently
reduced  to  permit  the  free  passage  of  merchandise.
Accordingly  the  Florentines  felt  braced  to  more  extensive
enterprise  in  the  Levant.  ^

The  Egyptian  route  was  the  easiest  and  most  direct
for  trading  purposes ;  but  sultan  and  califs  barred  the
road  to  Christians.  The  Venetians  alone,  from  having
concluded  treaties,  it  was  said,  "  in  the  holy  name  of
God  and  Mahomet,"  had  made  some  way  in  that  country
to  the  jealous  exclusion  of  all  other  Italians,  who  therefore
usually  travelled  by  Constantinople  and  the  Black  Sea,
where  they,  and  more  especially  the  Genoese,  had  founded
some  populous  and  flourishing  cities.  Farther  on,  by  the
Sea  of  Azofi^,  a  mile  or  so  from  the  mouth  of  the  Don,
stood  the  town  of  Tana  (Azov),  a  great  business  centre
for  traders  from  Russia,  Arabia,  Persia,  Armenia,  Mogul,
and   Southern   China  ;    and  the    chief  place  of  exchange

'  Ammirato,  ad  annum ;  Pagnini,  loc.  cit.


ITALIAN  TRADERS  IN  THE  LEVANT.         337

for  Eastern  and  Western  products.  The  Italians  brought
silk  or  woollen  fabrics,  oil,  wine,  pitch,  tar,  and  common
metals,  and  bartered  them  for  precious  stones,  pearls,
gold,  spices,  sweetmeats,  sugar.  Eastern  tissues  of  silk,
wool,  or  cotton,  raw  silk,  goatskins,  dye-woods,  and
likewise  for  Eastern  slaves  of  either  sex,  who  were  to  be
seen  in  Italy  down  to  the  end  of  the  jfifteenth  century. ^
All  this  varied  commerce,  originally  started  by  Amalfi
and  other  southern  states,  was  afterwards  carried  on  by
the  Venetians,  Genoese,  and  Pisans.  The  argosies  of
those  republics  traversed  all  parts  of  the  Archipelago,
the  Bosphorus,  and  the  Black  Sea.  Italian  was  spoken
in  all  the  harbours  of  the  East,  where,  besides  Italian
banks,  workshops,  and  factories,  there  were  cities  founded
and  inhabited  solely  by  Italians,  with  buildings  in  the
Genoese  or  Venetian  style,  but  where  Italian,  and  espe-
cially Venetian,  architecture  became  modified  by  Oriental
influences.  A  great  number  of  Genoese  were  settled  in
those  parts.  To  give  some  idea  of  the  naval  strength  of
Venice,  it  will  be  enough  to  say  that  during  the  Crusade
of  1202  that  Republic  equipped  a  fleet  able  to  convey
4,500  horsemen,  9,000  squires,  30,000  infantry,  and
stores  for  nine  months.  Their  galleys,  never  less  than
80  feet  in  length,  sometimes  measured  no  by  70  in
width,  and  in  the  fifteenth  century  were  forty-five  in
number,  with  a  total  of  11,000  seamen.  At  the  same
time  they  also  possessed  3,000  other  vessels  of  from  ten
to  one  hundred  tons,  with  17,000  men,  and  300  big
ships  with  8,000  men.  In  all,  therefore,  3,345  vessels,
with    36,000  seamen,2  a  strength  that  seems  positively

'  This  led  some  writers  to  believe  that  slavery  still  existed  in  Italy
many  centuries  after  it  had  disappeared.  A  praiseworthy  article  on  this
theme,  by  Signor  Salvatore  Bongi,  was  published  in  the  Nuova  Autologia,
anno  I.  No.  6.

incredible,  when  we  remember  that  the  '  Serenissima '  Re-
public of  Venice  was  a  city  built  on  the  sandbanks  of
the  lagoons  ;  that  the  entire  management  of  its  policy
and  trade  was  in  the  hands  of  men  born  within  the  narrow
bounds  of  those  lagoons.  Accordingly  we  may  imagine
how  great  was  the  united  strength  of  all  the  maritime
republics,  and  how  signal  the  courage  of  the  Florentines
in  competing  with  them  so  obstinately  for  the  Levantine
trade.

Before  launching  a  single  galley,  the  Florentines  had
already  established  many  houses  and  banks  in  every  place,
and  contrived  to  introduce  their  merchandise  in  all  the
principal  Eastern  ports.  We  not  only  find  them  doing
a  vast  business  at  Tana  with  great  energy  and  enterprise,
but  also  pushing  on  thence  to  far  remoter  regions.
Pegolotti  minutely  describes  the  route  followed  by  them,
their  manner  of  travelling,  and  the  time  employed  in  it.
They  journeyed,  he  tells  us,  through  Astracan  (Gittar-
chan),  to  Saracanco  (Sarai)  on  the  Volga,  thence  by
Organci  in  Zagataio,i  not  far  from  the  Caspian  Sea,  and
crossing  Asia  by  many  places  of  which  the  names  cannot  _
be  identified  with  any  known  at  this  day,  they  penetrated  1
as  far  as  Gambaluc,  or  Gamulecco,  the  chief  city  of  China,  ■
that  is  to  say,  the  city  of  Pekin.  They  employed  eight  |
or  ten  months  to  go  from  Tana  to  Pekin.  Thus  a  period
of  almost  two  years  was  required  for  the  journey  there
and  back  and  time  of  sojourn,  and  when  we  also  calculate
the  voyage  from  Porto  Pisano  or  Leghorn  to  Tana  and
back,  it  is  plain  that  a  Florentine  bound  for  Pekin  could
rarely  count  on  returning  home  within  three  years.^

THE  FLORENTINE  MERCHANT  FLEET.       339

During  the  growth  of  this  Eastern  trade,  carried  on
with  such  indomitable  energy,  amid  difficulties  of  all
kinds,  the  Florentines  were  always  aiming  at  the  com-
mand of  the  seaboard,  and  never  losing  sight  of  the
necessity  of  having  a  port  of  their  own.  And  when,  by
the  capture  of  Pisa  in  1406,  that  long-desired  object  was
finally  attained,  a  new  era  began  for  their  commerce.  All
their  business  concerns  became  most  rapidly  extended,  and
the  first  half  of  the  fifteenth  century  was  the  time  in
which  their  greatest  wealth  was  accumulated.  In  1421
they  appointed  "  consuls  of  the  sea,"  who  were  ordered  to
immediately  build  two  wide-beamed  merchant  galleons
{galee  di  mercato)  and  six  narrow  galleys,  and  to  continue
to  launch  one  of  either  kind  every  six  months,  for  the
which  purpose  a  monthly  sum  of  one  hundred  florins  was
assigned  from  the  revenues  of  the  Pisan  university.
Accordingly  Florence  soon  possessed  a  merchant  fleet  of
eleven  stout  galleons  and  fifteen  narrow  galleys  continu-
ally employed  in  the  Eastern  traffic  by  command  of  the
Republic.  All  these  vessels  had  strict  sailing  orders  as  to
the  course  to  be  taken,  the  ports  to  be  touched  at,  and  the
freight  to  be  carried.  Announcements  of  their  departure
and  arrival  were  hung  in  the  arcades  of  the  New  Market ;
and  the  vessels  being  chartered  by  private  individuals,  the
government  was  enabled  to  keep  the  Eastern  routes  open
to  all,  without  any  outlay.  In  1422,  when,  as  already
related,  the  *'  galley  florin  "  was  coined,  the  Florentines,  at
the  instance  of  one  Taddeo  Cenni,  a  merchant  long  estab-
lished in  Venice,  despatched  two  envoys  to  Egypt  to
obtain  the  right  of  having  a  church,  warehouses,  dockmen,
and  porters  of  their  own  at  Alexandria.  The  negotiation
II  proving  successful,  in  1423  they  instructed  the  "  consuls
of  the  sea  "  to  appoint  extra  consuls  at  every  port  where
their  presence  might  be  useful  to  Florentine  trade.  Some
had  been  established  for  more  or  less  time  at  Constanti-


340  THE  GREATER  GUILDS.

nople,  Pera  (1339),  and  London  (1402)  ;  but  from  this
moment  we  find  them  at  Alexandria,  Majorca,  Naples,
and  other  ports  in  all  directions.  These  consuls  had  offices
and  clerks  of  their  own,  interpreters,  men-at-arms,  and
places  of  worship  ;  and  all  their  expenses,  salary  included,
were  deducted  from  the  freight  dues  received  b}  dhem.'

To  fully  understand  to  what  extent  and  in  what  way
the  Florentines  profited  by  the  new  conditions  resulting
from  their  conquest  of  Pisa,  it  is  necessary  to  point  out
that  this  event  not  only  marks  the  time  of  their  highest
commercial  prosperity,  and  the  beginning  of  their  navy
and  merchant  fleet,  but  also  indicates  the  date  of  their
first  attention  to  nautical  and  astronomical  studies.  We
gain  another  proof  of  their  great  intelligence  and  untiring
activity  when  we  see  that  their  first  efforts  in  a  branch  of
learning  of  which  they  had  no  previous  knowledge  enabled
them  to  initiate  the  era  of  scientific  triumphs,  opening
with  Paolo  Toscanelli,  the  first  inspirer  of  Christopher
Columbus,  continued  by  Amerigo  Vespucci,  and  closing
with  Galileo  Galilei  and  his  imperishable  school.


V.

The  seven  guilds,  already  described  by  us,  were  styled
the  greater  guilds,  as  being  those  of  most  importance  and
having  the  chief  trade  and  wealth  of  the  State  in  their
hands.  Several  of  these  guilds  consisted,  as  we  have  seen,
rather  of  different  crafts  banded  together,  than  of  a  single
branch  of  industry  ;  they  gave  employment  to  many
workers,  gathered  and  made  use  of  enormous  funds.  But
Florence  also  possessed  the  so-called  lesser  guilds  number-

This  very  brief  but  excellent  work  was  published  anonymously  at  Ham-
burg in  1844.    It  has  furnished  many  of  the  details  given  in  this  chapter.


THE  LESSER  GUILDS  AND  CRAFTS.  341

ing  fourteen  in  all,  namely  :  Linenmakers  and  Mercers,
Shoemakers,  Smiths,  Salters,  Butchers  and  Slaughterers,
Wine-dealers,  Innkeepers,  Harnessmakers,  Leatherdressers,
Armourers,  Ironmongers,  Masons,  Carpenters,  Bakers. ^

Certain  smaller  Florentine  crafts  had  also  obtained  great
repute  in  Italy  :  for  instance,  that  of  the  wood  and  stone
carvers,  who  were  esteemed  as  some  of  the  best  in  the
world.  In  all  work  demanding  any  share  of  artistic  ability
the  Tuscans  stood  unrivalled.  Thus  the  Florentine
moulders  of  waxen  images  were  considered  to  have
incomparable  skill,  and  we  even  find  this  remarked  by  the
chronicler  Dei.  But  neither  the  carvers  nor  the  wax
moulders  formed  an  association,  and  were  artists  rather
than  artizans.  But,  leaving  this  question  aside,  the  lesser
guilds,  although  numerous  and  energetic,  failed  to  achieve
any  noteworthy  influence.  Their  difference  from  the
greater  guilds  mainly  lay  in  the  fact  that,  being  solely
concerned  with  the  local  trade  of  the  Republic,  they  were
confined  to  a  very  limited  field  of  business  and  enterprise,
while  the  others  engaged  in  the  trade  with  the  East  and
the  West,  were  enabled  to  attain  a  high  position  even  in
politics,  and  to  finally  become  masters  of  the  State.

Looking  back  on  the  period  in  which  the  greater  guilds
rose  to  power,  we  shall  see  that  they  simultaneously  held
in  their  grasp  the  commerce,  wealth,  and  government  of
the  Florentine  Republic.  We  shall  also  readily  under,
stand  the  enormous  energy  they  must  have  displayed  in
order  to  use  politics  as  a  means  for  increasing  the
opulence  that,  in  the  existing  conditions  of  Italy,  had
become  the  chief  strength  of  our  communes.  The
Florentine  merchants,  having  long  divined  that  the  future
would  belong  to  them,  were  always  the  firmest  supporters
of  the  Guelph  party  against  the  Imperial  Ghibellinism  of

the  nobles  and  had  vowed  eternal  hatred  to  the  latter.
We  may  now  imagine  Florence  as  a  huge  house  of
business,  situated  in  the  centre  of  Tuscany,  and  sur-
rounded by  others  all  competing  with  it  in  the  race  for
success.  International  law  and  equity  were  unknown  to
the  Middle  Ages :  hence  when  any  State  felt  envious  of
its  neighbour,  the  obvious  course  to  adopt  was  to  prohibit
that  neighbour  from  traversing  its  territory,  and  exact
unbearably  heavy  dues  from  the  rival  it  feared.  Accord-
ingly, the  Republic  of  Florence,  being  the  object  of  still
fiercer  jealousy  on  account  of  the  continual  increase  of  its
commerce,  and  lacking  room  to  breathe,  as  it  were,
without  access  to  the  sea,  would  have  been  speedily
reduced  to  impotence  had  it  not  resisted  its  neighbours  by
force  of  arms.  Hence,  the  necessity  of  defending  its
existence  involved  the  State  in  an  uninterrupted  series  of
wars,  invariably  terminated  by  treaties  of  commerce,  in
which  the  unfailing  subtlety  of  the  Florentines  always
won  the  advantage.

We  have  seen  from  the  beginning  how  Florence  com-
bated the  neighbouring  barons  in  order  to  secure  the
progress  of  its  dawning  trade,  and  subsequently  obtained
a  passage  through  the  Mugello  for  its  increased  traffic
with  Romagna  and  Lombardy.  Later  on,  we  have  seen  it
engaged  in  fiercer  struggles,  and,  after  many  vicissitudes,
subduing  almost  all  the  Ghibelline  cities  of  Tuscany,  as,
for  instance,  Volterra,  Sienna,  and  Arezzo.  And  when
inquiring  why  Florence  should  have  remained  so  obsti-
nately Guelph,  even  in  the  face  of  Papal  threats,  and
repeating  the  same  question  Farinata  put  to  Dante —

"Dimmi,  perche  quel  popolo  h  si  empio
Incontro  a'  miei  in  ciascuna  sua  legge  ?"'


Inferno,"  Canto  x.


CA  USE  OF  CONTINUAL  STRIFE  WITH  PISA.      343

the  invariable  reply  has  been  that  in  addition  to  political
motives  of  a  more  general  nature,  it  must  be  kept  in  mind
that  the  plutocracy  now  risen  to  power  had  first  attained
wealth  by  doing  its  chief  business  with  Rome.  Sienna,
Arezzo,  and  Volterra  being  on  the  road  and  closer  to
Rome,  were  doomed  to  defeat  in  any  competition  with
Florence.

Then,  as  soon  as  the  Republic  had  secured  its  hold  on
Roman  affairs  and  the  Lombard  trade,  we  saw  its
irresistible  need  of  access  to  the  sea,  and  that  a  war  of
extermination  with  Pisa  had  become  altogether  inevitable.
To  suppose  that  this  prolonged,  constantly  renewed  and
sanguinary  conflict  was  solely  caused  by  a  blind  instinctive
hatred  of  Pisa,  when  other  and  more  serious  reasons  were
so  plainly  existent,  would  be  to  deny  the  evidence  of  facts.
From  beginning  to  end  it  was  simply  the  clash  of  violently
opposed  interests.  The  Pisans  were  perfectly  aware  that
to  yield  a  fi-ee  passage  to  the  power  already  commanding  the
chief  trade  in  the  interior  of  Italy — the  power  that,  without
having  as  yet  a  single  galley  afloat,  had  already  made  its
way  to  all  the  harbours  of  the  East — the  power  so  per-
sistently struggling  for  absolute  supremacy  in  Tuscany —
could  only  lead  to  their  own  lasting  subjection.  There-
fore they  resisted  to  the  utmost  of  their  strength.  Their
resources  were  undoubtedly  great,  and  as  many  other
Italians  were  equally  hostile  to  the  supremacy  of  Florence,
the  latter  could  never  have  succeeded  in  reducing  the
Pisans,  had  it  not  constantly  employed  the  shrewdest
devices  in  addition  to  its  efforts  in  the  field.  In  fact  there
is  no  better  proof  of  the  political  ability  of  the  Florentines
than  their  mode  of  conducting  this  war  and  the  means
they  employed  to  attain  the  object  that,  throughout  the
whole  course  of  their  history,  had  been  their  chief  and  in-
variable aim.  We  find  them  steadfast  in  their  friendship
to  Lucca,  and  always  prompt  to  succour  that  city  at  all


344  THE  GREATER  GUILDS.

costs,  because  Lucca  was  never  well  disposed  to  the  Pisans,
and  might   prove  a  most    useful  ally   in    any  campaign
against  them.     So,  too,  we  always  find  Florence  on  good
terms  with   Genoa,    and  avoiding  every  risk    of  giving
offence  to  a  power  that  was  Pisa's  natural  rival  on  the  seas.
Indeed,  the  Florentines  always  did  their  best  to  foster  that
rivalry,  inasmuch  as  without  an  ally  strong  enough  to
assist  them  by  crushing  Pisa's  power  by  sea,  they  could
never  hope  to  overthrow  it  by  land.    And  at  last  the  Pisans
were   defeated    by   the    Genoese   in   the    naval  battle    of
Meloria  (August  6,  1284).     From  that  day  the  conquest
of  Pisa  by  the  Florentines,  although  still  to  be  long  con-
tested, was  a  foregone  conclusion,  and  from  that  moment
also  their  friendship  for  the  Genoese  began  to  lose  warmth.
While  desiring  assistance  in  overcoming  Pisa,  they  wished
to  avoid  aggrandising  the  power  of  a  Ghibelline  republic,
already   very   mighty   on   the   sea.      Accordingly,  after
having  so  furiously  attacked  and  enfeebled  Pisa,  we  find
them  aiding  that  state  to  withstand  the  Genoese,  until  the
moment  came  when  the  latter  having  abandoned  the  idea
of  conquering  Pisa,  they  could  successfully  undertake  its
conquest  on  their  own  account.

With  equal  sagacity  they  pursued  the  same  course  in
the  years  during  which  they  were  menaced  by  the  power-
ful Dukes  of  Milan  who  sought  to  become  masters  ot
all  Italy,  and  also  when  threatened  from  the  south  by  the
enmity  of  King  Ladislaus  of  Naples.  The  art  of  stirring
division  among  their  foes,  of  supporting  the  weaker  party
against  overbearing  neighbours,  of  constantly  contriving
to  rouse  half  Italy  against  every  potentate  risen  to
sufficient  strength  to  be  a  terror  to  their  own  Republic,
was  the  invariable  means  by  which  Florence  maintained
her  independence  in  the  midst  of  States  who  were  losing
their  liberty,  and  m  the  midst  of  the  numerous  and
formidable  foes  pressing  about  her  on    all  sides.     And


STATESMANSHIP  OF  FLORENTINE  MERCHANTS.  345

this  successful  policy  was  the  work  of  the  greater  guilds,
or  rather  of  the  prosperous  trading  class  (^popolani  grassi).
These  mercantile  aristocrats  ruled  the  Republic  with
so  nr-uch  energy  and  zeal,  precisely  because  the  aggrandise-
ment of  Florence  conduced  at  the  same  time  to  the
increase  of  their  own  wealth  and  commerce.  Thus  a  city
whose  population  was  seldom  more  than  100,000,  and
often  shrank  far  below  that  number,  and  whose  narrow
territory  was  surrounded  by  so  many  enemies,  was  enabled
to  become  a  State  feared  by  the  rest  of  Italy,  and  respected
throughout  Europe.  These  Florentine  merchants  were  so
jealous  of  their  liberty  as  to  deem  no  sacrifice  too  vast  for
its  preservation,  and  were  neither  bewildered  nor  daunted
by  any  danger,  even  when  their  trade  was  at  stake.  In
fact,  although  so  obstinately  Guelph,  and  connected  with
Rome  by  so  many  commercial  interests  and  ties,  we  find
them  ready  to  combat  the  Pope  himself,  when  he  made
attacks  on  their  liberty,  and  see  them  giving  the  name
of  the  Eight  Saints  to  the  magistrates  charged  to  con-
duct the  campaign  against  Gregory  XL  (1376).  In  the
like  manner  we  find  them  carrying  on  a  war  with  the
Visconti  of  Milan  at  a  yearly  cost  of  millions  of  florins,
without  the  resources  of  the  Republic  being  exhausted,  or
the  courage  of  its  rulers  worn  out.

VI.

Nevertheless,  it  would  be  an  error  to  suppose  that  the
domination  of  the  greater  guilds  was  assured  and  uncon-
tested in  the  interior,  at  least,  of  the  city.  On  the  day
when  the  scheme  was  first  mooted,  in  the  Calimala  court,
of  placing  these  guilds  at  the  head  of  the  government,
they  speedily  recognised  that  the  possibility  of  success
was  solely  owed  to  the  fact  of  their  having  fought  and
conquered  the  nobles  with   the  help  of  the  lesser  arts.


346  THE  GREATER  GUILDS.

Hence,  on  the  one  hand,  they  had  to  face  their  natural
and  inveterate  foes,  the  survivors  of  the  feudal  order,
and  on  the  other  the  lesser  guilds  coveting  a  share  in  the
government  which  they  had  helped  to  establish.  Thus
the  Republic  comprised  three  classes  of  citizens  and  three
separate  parties.  It  is  true  that  the  greater  guilds  consti-
tuted by  far  the  stronger  of  the  three  factions,  but  the
others  might  become,  if  united,  a  very  formidable  opposi-
tion.    And  their  union  was  no  impossible  contingency.

The  difference,  in  fact,  between  the  greater  and  lesser
guilds  was  not  merely  one  of  degree  as  regarded  their
respective  wealth  and  power  ;  what  divided  them  was  the
diversity  of  interests  urging  them  to  pursue  an  opposite
policy.  The  wool-dresser  or  silk  merchant  was  always
ready  to  sacrifice  his  last  florin,  provided  the  Republic
could  gain  possession  of  Leghorn  or  Porto  Pisano.  Ac-
cordingly he  invariably  kept  a  strict  watch  on  the  policy  of
Lucca  and  Genoa,  to  prevent  them  from  making  friendly
akivances  to  the  Pisans.  The  Florentine  banker  was
anxious  that  his  Republic  should  always  possess  skilful
ambassadors  and  consuls,  able  to  supply  full  details  of  all
that  occurred  in  Rome,  Antwerp,  or  Caffa,  and  impede
the  Siennese,  Genoese,  Venetians,  and  Lombards  from
gaining  too  much  influence  in  those  cities.  Where  any
question  of  this  kind  was  concerned  the  members  of  the
greater  guilds  were  always  disposed  to  promote  hostilities,
no  matter  how  prolonged,  expensive,  or  dangerous,  and
to  subject  both  themselves  and  the  State  to  unlimited
sacrifices.  But  financial  and  political  interests  weighed
little  with  the  blacksmiths,  masons,  carpenters,  and  other
members  of  the  fourteen  lesser  guilds,  which  nevertheless
formed  so  considerable  a  part  of  the  Florentine  popula-
tion. It  mattered  far  more  to  them  that  Florence  should
be  inhabited  by  rich  and  splendid  gentry  ;  that  sumptuous
palaces,  villas,  and  monumental  churches  should  have  to


DIFFERENT  TEMPER  OF  THE  GUILDS,       347

be  built ;  that  there  should  be  a  continual  increase  of
luxury  and  good  living  among  the  citizens  of  rank  and
wealth,  by  whom  they  earned  their  subsistence.  Warfare,
on  the  contrary,  put  a  check  upon  luxury,  and  the  greater
guilds  were  always  issuing  decrees  against  it,  precisely  on
account  of  the  exigences  of  the  wars  they  so  constantly  had
on  hand.  Hence  the  poorer  classes  detested  the  opulent
burghers,  whom  they  had  helped  to  raise  to  power,  who
had  subsequently  excluded  them,  as  well  as  the  nobles,
from  the  government,  and  who,  while  accumulating  untold
millions,  often  lived  in  the  city  on  a  footing  of  Spartan
frugality  ;  the  men  daily  promulgating  new  edicts
against  female  luxury  in  dress ;  forbidding  the  use  of
gold  and  silver  ornaments,  prohibiting  all  lavish  expenditure
for  entertainments  or  wedding  banquets,  even  going  so  far
as  to  limit  the  number  and  choice  of  viands,  and  exclude
gold  and  silver  plate  from  festive  tables  ;  but  who,  never-
theless, were  always  very  ready  to  squander  millions  in
attacks  on  the  Pisans,  the  King  of  Naples,  the  Visconti  of
Milan,  or  even  for  a  church,  or  an  additional  consul
at  Caffa  or  Pera.  This  difference  of  temper  generated
party  hatred.  Nor  should  it  be  omitted  that  some  of  the
bitterest  outcries  against  the  greater  guilds  came  from
the  women  of  Florence,  who,  being  naturally  opposed  to
warfare,  and  addicted  to  extravagance,  objected  to  the
vexatious  restrictions  imposed  by  law,  while  yet  contriv-
ing to  evade  them  with  indescribable  ingenuity. ^

'  Franco  Sacchetti  tells  us  that  while  he  was  a  member  of  the  govern-
ment the  magistrates  of  the  Republic  never  succeeded  in  enforcing  the
laws  against  luxury.  One  of  them,  having  been  severely  reprimanded
on  this  score  and  threatened  with  dismissal  from  office,  gives  the  follow-
ing account  of  the  devices  by  which  Florentine  women  evaded  the  regula-
tions established  by  law  :

"  Signori  miei, — All  my  life  I  have  sought  to  acquire  reason  ;  and  now,
when  methought  I  knew  something,  I  find  I  know  nothing  ;  inasmuch  as
when  searching  for  forbidden  ornaments,  according  to  your  orders,  the
women  bring  forward  arguments  of  a  kind  never  found  by  me  in  any
iaw ;  and  among  others  I  will  quote  these :  There  comes  a  woman  with  an


i


348  THE  GREATER  GUILDS.

It  is  very  easy  to  realise  how  good  an  opportunity  this
afforded  the  nobles  of  gaining  the  favour  of  the  populace
by  stirring  these  germs  of  discord.  They  exercised  no
trade,  lived  on  their  revenues,  but  spent  freely  and  lavishly
in  Florence.  Accordingly,  whenever  engaged  in  fresh
attempts  to  seize  the  government,  or  preserve  their
remaining  share  in  it,  they  always  allied  themselves  with
the  mob  that  lived — or  at  least  believed  itself  to  live —
solely  at  their  expense,  and  roused  its  resentment  against
t\\Q  popolani  grassi — or  well-to-do  burghers — by  dwelling
on  the  fact  that  whereas  all  the  guilds  were  equally  engaged
in  trade  and  commerce,  a  considerable  number  of  them
had  no  share  in  the  power  exclusively  monopolised  by  the
rest.  The  democratic  spirit  was  far  too  lively  in  Florence
for  these  devices  to  assure  the  safety  of  the  nobles,  much
less  their  return  to  power  ;  but  they  had  the  effect  of
stirring  the  masses  to  a  burning  and  irresistible  thirst  for
power,  and  of  awakening  revolutionary  passions  in  the
mob.  Thus,  at  the  moment  of  finally  losing  their  old
supremacy  in  the  city,  the  nobles  achieved  the  revenge
of  bequeathing  to  Florence  a  prolonged  inheritance  of
strife  that  kept  the  Republic  divided,  and  hastened  its
fall.

In  fact,  when  at  last  the  lesser  guilds  obtained  a  share

embroidered  trimming  turned  down  over  her  hood,  and  the  notary  says,
'  Give  me  your  name,  since  you  wear  an  embroidered  trimming.'  The
good  woman  takes  off  this  trimming,  which  is  fastened  to  the  hood  by  a
pin,  and,  holding  it  in  her  hand,  declares  it  is  a  garland.  He  goes  to
another  woman  and  says,  '  I  find  you  have  too  many  buttons  on  the  front
of  your  gown;  you  must  not  wear  those  buttons.'  But  she  replies,  'Yes,
Messere,  I  can,  for  these  are  not  buttons,  but  bosses  ;  and  if  you  do  not
believe  me,  see,  they  have  no  shanks,  and  neither  are  there  button-holes.'
The  notary  passes  on  to  another  woman  wearing  ermine  fur,  saying  to
himself,  '  What  excuse  can  she  allege  for  that  ?  You  wear  ermine,'  and
he  begins  to  write  her  name.  The  woman  says,  '  Do  not  write  me  down,
for  this  is  not  ermine,  but  lattizzi  fur.'  Says  the  notary,  '  What  are  these
laitizzif  'They  are  animals.  .  .  .'  One  of  the  magistrates  says,  'We
are  trying  to  fight  against  a  wall.'  And  another  remarks,  '  It  were  better
to  attend  to  affairs  of  more  importance  ! ' "  (Novella,  137.)


SAGACITY  AND  STEADFASTNESS  OF  BURGHERS.  349

in  the  government,  they  were  never  at  one  with  the
greater  trades.  Their  hostility  was  continually  shown
in  all  councils,  tribunals,  and  public  gatherings  ;  and
they  sometimes  resorted  to  the  perilous  means  of  in-
flaming the  worst  passions  of  the  mob  which,  as  usual,
served  as  a  ready  tool  for  ambitious  aims.  In  this  way
a  spirit  of  anarchy  was  unloosed,  leading  first  to  the
revolt  of  the  Ciompi,  then  to  the  necessity  of  seeking  a
protector  for  the  Republic,  and  finally  to  the  rule  of  the
Medici.  But  before  arriving  at  these  extremities,  there
were  two  centuries  of  struggle,  during  which  Florentine
affairs  were  almost  invariably  in  the  hands  of  the
burghers.  On  several  occasions  the  reins  of  power
seemed  to  have  slipped  from  their  grasp,  but  they  always
managed  to  retain  enough  influence  to  secure  the  election
of  magistrates  of  their  own  choice.  In  this  way  victory
was  restored  to  them,  and  they  again  took  possession  of
the  government.  When,  on  the  other  hand,  the  triumph
of  anarchy  made  it  requisite  to  seek  a  protector,  and  this
protector,  summoned  to  the  defence  of  the  Republic,
sided  with  the  malcontents  and  tried  to  establish  a
tyranny,  the  burghers  then  contrived  to  unite  every
faction  in  the  interest  of  their  common  freedom  and
reinstate  the  Republican  government,  thus  giving  it  a
fresh  lease  of  life.  By  dint  of  incredible  sagacity,  daring,
and  steadfastness,  they  managed  to  struggle  on  amid  a
thousand  dangers,  both  within  and  without  the  walls.
Although  plunged  in  perpetual  conflict  with  those  who
desired  peace  and  claimed  ever  wider  rights  ;  although
surrounded  by  most  powerful  external  foes  now  attempting
to  destroy  their  trade,  now  their  Republic,  their  energy
and  patriotism  never  wearied,  never  failed  to  be  on  the
alert.  It  was  a  feverish  time  of  unceasing  stress  and
strain,  and  freedom,  though  always  on  the  verge  of
annihilation,  was  kept  alive  for  two  centuries  in  the  midst


350  THE  GREATER  GUILDS.

of  cornmunities  where  it  was  perishing.  And  even  as  the
burghers  had  managed  to  create  all  sorts  of  financial
combinations  for  the  increase  of  trade  and  multiplication
of  wealth,  so  they  showed  inexhaustible  ingenuity  in
devising:  new  schemes  and  institutions  to  prolong  the  life
of  their  Republic.

In  matters  of  forei^  policy  Florentine  diplomats
became  so  renowned  for  sagacity  and  quick-wittedness,
that  on  certain  points  they  enjoyed  even  higher  repute
than  the  famed  ambassadors  of  Venice.  The  latter,  in
fact,  with  their  old  traditions  of  statecraft,  pursued  the
invariable  policv  of  a  strong,  calm  and  self-reliant  govern-
ment. Their  strength  was  the  outcome  of  the  strength
and  wisdom  of  a  republic  commanding  both  fear  and
respect,  and  whose  voice  seemed  to  be  heard  in  the  speech
of  its  envovs.  Every  Florentine  amba^ador  exercised,
on  the  contrar}',  a  direct  personal  influence,  due  to  his
own  sharpness  of  intellect,  extraordinary  knowledge  of
mankind,  and  marvellous  aptitude  for  comprehending
evCTything  and  making  everything  clearly  understood,
Undoubtodiy  the  State  acted  in  him  and  by  him  ;  but
less  because  he  served  as  its  mouthpiece  than  because
it  had  succeeded  in  evoking  and  training  all  his  mental
powers  and  rendering  him  an  intelligent  and  independent
personality.  Florentine  merchants,  notaries,  administra-
tOTS,  and  diplomats  were  universally  prized,  and  seemed
at  home  in  every  corner  of  the  globe.  Hence  it  is  said
that  one  dav  Pope  Boniface  VIII.,  seeing  that  the
ambassadOTS  sent  to  him  from  different  parts  of  the  world
were  one  and  all  Florentines,  quietly  remarked,  ''You
Florentines  are  the  fifth  element  in  creation."

It  was  in  the  midst  of  these  political  conflicts,  of  this
ferment  of  the  human  mind,  that  art  and  literature  rose
to  such  splendour,  that  the  whole  world  was,  as  it  were,
illuminated  by  the  radiance  shed  by  Italian  cities,  and


STRUGGLES  AND  CHANGES.  351

shining  most  brightly  from  Florence.  The  far-reaching
energy  of  this  city  of  commerce  and  trade  was  felt  almost
everywhere  ;  but  even  at  points  where  this  had  failed  to
penetrate,  the  genius  of  Florentine  literature  and  art
seems  to  have  asserted  its  power  and  initiated  modern
culture  in  Europe.

VII.

All  this,  however,  was  carried  on  in  the  face  of  con-
tinual and  new  dangers,  threatening  the  very  life  of  the
Republic,  and  sometimes  only  to  be  averted  by  super-
human efforts.  Memory  instinctively  carries  us  back  to
the  Florence  of  old  with  its  council  and  its  Consuls,  yearly
taking  the  field  united  and  agreed,  for  the  purpose  of
abasing;  the  nobles  and  clearing  the  highways  for  the
march  of  its  trade ;  and  then,  having  reduced  the  hostile
barons  one  by  one,  compelling  them  to  live  within  the
walls,  subject  to  the  equal  pressure  of  republican  laws  ; —
to  the  times  when  the  State  could  only  overcome  its  more
powerful  neighbours  by  emancipating  the  slaves  of  the
soil  and  granting  political  privileges  to  traders  hitherto
unpossessed  of  any  such  rights.  On  recalling  those  times,
we  easily  recomise  that  thev  contained  the  serms  of  future
greatness  for  the  Commune  that  by  dint  of  continual
warfare  succeeded  in  ausrnenting  its  resources  in  every
direction.  Later,  however,  things  were  radically  changed,
owing  to  many  causes,  and  above  all  in  consequence  of
the  new  method  of  warfare  to  which  we  have  already
alluded  and  which  must  now  be  more  fully  described.

Down  to  the  fourteenth  century  republican  armies
were  composed  of  foot  soldiers,  lightiy  equipped  with
sword,  shield,  and  helmet,  and  some  slight  defensive
armour  for  leg  or  breast.  The  horse  were  few  in  number
and  never  decided  the  fate  of  a  batde.     All   barbarian


352  THE  GREATER  GUILDS.

armies  had  been  composed  much  on  the  same  plan,
excepting  those  of  the  Huns  and  Moors,  who  were  almost
always  mounted,  and  of  the  Byzantines,  whose  cavalry
had  frequently  defeated  the  Goths.  Frederic  Barba-
rossa's  Italian  campaigns  had  been  chiefly  carried  on
by  infantry  and  withstood  by  the  infantry  of  our
communes,  who  could  then  turn  all  able-bodiea
citizens  into  soldiers  at  a  moment's  notice.  But  in
the  campaigns  of  Frederic  II.,  Manfred  and  Charles  of
Anjou,  a  new  method  of  war  had  been  imported  into
Italy  from  Germany  and  France.  The  Florentines  had
learnt  this  to  their  cost  at  the  battle  of  Montaperti,  when
their  numerous  army  was  routed  by  the  charge  of  a  few
German  horse.  From  that  moment  the  issue  of  all  Italian
battles  began  to  be  decided  by  heavy  cavalry  or  by  men-
at-arms.  The  mounted  soldier  was  clad  in  steel  from
head  to  foot,  although  not  yet,  as  at  the  close  of  the
fifteenth  century,  encased,  together  with  his  steed,  in  such
ponderous  armour,  that,  once  fallen,  neither  could  rise
from  the  ground  without  help.  Armed  with  a  very  long
lance,  the  horseman  could  overthrow  the  foot  soldier
before  the  latter  could  approach  him  with  his  short  sword.
Besides,  this  weapon  never  served  to  pierce  the  armour
either  of  man  or  horse  ;  and  the  arrows  of  the  bowmen
«vere  equally  useless.  Accordingly,  a  few  hundred  men-
at-arms  pushed  forward  like  a  movable  and  impregnable
fortress  into  the  midst  of  a  host  of  infantry  sufficed  to
rout  it  in  a  very  short  time.  This  state  of  things  lasted
until  the  invention  of  powder  and  firearms  produced  a
radical  change  in  the  condition  of  the  Italian  communes.
For  mounted  troops  required  much  training  and  great
expenditure.  It  was  not  enough  to  maintain  great
arsenals,  to  create  and  train  a  new  breed  of  horses,  but
every  trooper  had  also  to  be  kept  in  steady  practice,  devote
his  whole  time  to  warfare,  and  keep  two  or  three  squires


RISE  OF  MERCENARY  BANDS.  353

continuously  drilled  and  employed.  These  squires  carried
ail  the  armour  and  weapons  and  led  the  knight's  charger,
which  was  only  used  in  battle.  Only  then,  too,  were
knight  and  steed  in  full  harness,  otherwise  both  would
have  been  exhausted  in  the  hour  of  danger.  Hence
it  was  impossible  for  our  republics  to  raise  cavalry,  seeing
that  citizens,  earning  their  living  by  trade  and  commerce,
could  not  forsake  their  daily  work  to  acquire  the  art  of
war.  Therefore,  soldiering  became  a  regular  trade,  and
all  choosing  it  for  their  career  speedily  began  to  put  a
price  on  their  swords.  Thus  from  the  closing  years  of
the  thirteenth  century  we  begin  to  find  soldiers  of  various
nationalities — Catalans,  Burgundians,  Germans,  and  other
foreign  horse — in  the  ranks  of  republican  armies,  and  the
number  of  these  mercenaries  was  continually  on  the
increase.

Gradually,  also,  tradesmen  were  obliged  to  recognise
that  they  had  become  personally  useless  in  the  field.
Accordingly,  whenever  the  republics  were  threatened  with
attack,  they  no  longer  ventured  to  give  battle  without
hiring  some  captain  with  a  band  of  foreign  horse.  Italian
valour  rapidly  lost  its  prestige,  and  "  Companies  or
Adventure  " — soon  to  be  the  cause  of  our  direst  calamities
— began  to  be  formed.  Later  on,  it  is  true  that  when
Alberico  da  Barbiano,  Attendolo  Sforza,  Braccio  da
Montone,  and  others  adopted  the  same  career,  they
rivalled  and  even  surpassed  the  foreign  adventurers,  who
had  now  often  to  yield  the  palm  to  Italian  courage.
Soon,  in  fact,  many  came  from  afar  to  learn  the  new
art  of  war  under  these  Italian  captains  whose  skill  first
reduced  it  to  a  science.  Nevertheless,  few  citizens  of
free  states  were  able  to  devote  their  whole  life  to  war.
It  was  the  nobles,  the  exiles,  the  unemployed — knowing
nO  other  trade — and  the  subjects  of  petty  tyrants  who
joined  the  "  Companies  of  Adventure."     And  whether

small  bands  or  large,  Italian  or  foreign,  they  invariably
hastened  the  ruin  of  all  our  communes,  and  more
especially  of  Florence.  The  continual  wars  in  which
this  State  was  now  engaged  no  longer  served  to  foster  the
military  spirit  and  energy  of  its  people.  Always  com-
pelled to  rely  on  the  help  of  foreign  mercenaries,  it  soon
lost  all  confidence  in  its  own  resources,  the  which  there-
fore rapidly  declined.  A  campaign  simply  implied  some
financial  operation,  or  the  levying  of  fresh  taxes  to
furnish  sufficient  capital  for  the  hire  of  one  of  the
captains  of  adventure,  who  always  closed  with  the  highest
bid.  The  money  found,  it  was  often  enough  to  send  it
to  the  State's  surest  and  most  powerfiil  ally,  who  under-
took to  complete  the  affair  by  engaging  the  captain  best
able  to  hire  the  largest  number  of  men.  So  the  chief
thing  was  to  know  how  to  gain  friends  and  excite  enemies
against  the  foe,  and  in  this  the  Florentines  always  showed
masterly  skill.  But  these  devices  were  no  proof  of
military  capacity.  The  most  important  personages  de-
spatched by  them  to  the  seat  of  war  were  commissioners
charged  to  superintend  the  general  proceedings,  the
administration  of  the  army,  and  the  political  object  of
the  campaign,  and  although  we  sometimes  find  these
commissioners  suddenly  transformed  into  captains,  taking
command  of  the  forces  and  deciding  the  fate  of  a  battle
with  singular  daring,  their  functions  were  always  civil
and  diplomatic  rather  than  military.

It  is  easy  to  foresee  the  final  results  of  this  method
with  regard  to  the  future  of  the  Republic,  and  the  morals
of  its  inhabitants.  The  stout  burghers  at  the  head  of
the  government  were  engaged  in  the  continual  practice
of  cunning  and  craft.  It  was  requisite  to  show  adroitness
in  the  council  chamber  ;  to  thwart  the  nobles ;  to  remain
constantly  on  the  alert  to  prevent  the  populace  from
growing  unruly,  while  persuading  it  to  furnish  funds  to


DEPENDENCE  ON  MERCENARY  TROOPS.      355

carry  on  wars  which  were  indispensable  to  secure  the
safety  and  prosperity  of  the  foreign  trade.  Hence,  still
greater  subtlety  was  needed  in  diplomatic  negotiations  to
avoid  being  isolated,  and  to  continually  maintain  the
equilibrium  of  Italian  States  in  the  way  most  advantageous
for  the  Republic.  Even  actual  warfare  being  now  re-
duced, as  we  have  seen,  to  a  financial  operation,  had  come
to  be  a  fresh  proof  of  ingenuity.  There  were  no  longer
any  of  those  vast  sacrifices  of  citizens'  blood  and  citizens'
lives  which  serve  towards  the  continued  regeneration
of  a  people,  no  longer  any  deeds  of  open  and  generous
violence.  And  at  times  when  the  rich  burghers  were  not
absorbed  in  politics,  they  and  all  the  rest  of  the  citizens
were  devoted  heart  and  soul  to  commerce,  employing
their  leisure  moments  in  the  study  of  Tacitus,  Virgil,  or
Homer,  kept  ready  to  hand  under  their  counters.  But,
invariably,  it  was  only  the  intelligence  that  was  kept  always
in  training,  while  the  nobler  faculties  remained  strangled
and  atrophied  by  the  constant  use  of  cunning  and  trickery.
This  was  destined  to  lead,  sooner  or  later,  to  the  inevitable
decay  of  the  Republic's  moral  and  political  life,  and  to
the  decline  of  the  highest  mental  culture.  If  the  manner
in  which  wars  were  planned  and  conducted  caused  fatal
results,  no  less  fatal  were  the  ulterior  consequences  of
victorious  campaigns.  For  the  hired  troops  once  paid
off,  changed  from  friends  into  foes,  and  instantly  sought
to  sell  their  services  to  some  other  employer.  Failing  to
find  one,  and  therefore  receiving  no  pay,  they  dispersed
in  armed  bands,  ravaging  town  and  country,  by  a  species
of  military  brigandage.  Generally,  it  was  found  requisite
to  come  to  terms  with  them,  and  bribe  them  to  keep  the
peace.

But  the  most  important  point  to  be  noted  at  this
juncture  is  that  the  conquest  of  fresh  territory,  although
become  an  absolute  necessity  to  the  Republic,  now  began


356  THE  GREATER  GUILDS,

to  be  a  serious  danger  and  the  source  of  future  calamities.
During  the  Middle  Ages  the  Italian  Commune  had  been
a  fertile  cause  of  progress  ;  but  as  its  possessions  outside
the  walls  began  to  increase,  it  proved  wholly  powerless
to  convert  the  free  city  into  what  we  call  a  State  without
working  radical  changes  in  its  constitution.  In  fact,  even
in  Florence,  the  most  democratic  of  our  communes,
citizens  were  only  to  be  found  within  the  circuit  of  the
walls.  Laws  were  framed  to  ameliorate  the  condition  of
the  territory  outside  and  to  abolish  serfdom  there,  but  no
one  contemplated  endowing  inhabitants  of  the  contado  with
political  rights.  The  title  of  citizens  always  remained,
as  it  were,  a  privilege  only  granted  to  a  minority,  even
of  dwellers  within  the  walls,  and  was  never  extended  to
the  people  at  large.  Whenever  a  new  city  was  conquered
and  subjected  to  the  Republic,  it  was  governed  more  or
less  harshly ;  allowed  to  retain  more  or  fewer  local
privileges  ;  sometimes  even  permitted  to  retain  a  re-
publican form  of  government,  subject  to  the  authority
of  a  Podesta,  captain,  or  commissary,  and  paying  the  taxes
imposed  by  them  ;  but  its  inhabitants  never  enjoyed  the
freedom  of  the  City,  nor  were  their  representatives  by
any  chance  admitted  to  the  councils  or  political  offices  of
Florence.  Accordingly,  as  the  State  became  enlarged  by
fresh  conquests,  the  cluster  of  citizens  monopolising  the
government,  and  already  very  limited  in  number,  sank  to
a  still  smaller  minority  compared  with  the  ever-increasing
population  subject  to  their  rule.  Similarly  to  all  other
republicans  of  the  Middle  Ages,  the  Florentines  were
altogether  unable  to  conceive  the  idea  of  a  State  governed
with  a  view  to  the  general  welfare.  On  the  contrary,  the
prosperity  and  grandeur  of  Florence  formed  the  one  object
and  aim  to  which  every  other  consideration  had  to  be
subservient.  Nor  had  the  lower  classes  and  populace,
who  were  always  clamouring  for  increased  freedom,  any


SHORT-SIGHTED  POLICY,  357

different  or  wider  views  on  the  subject.  Their  ideas,
indeed,  being  restricted  in  a  narrower  circle,  were  even
more  prejudiced,  as  their  passions  were  blinder.  Con-
sequently it  was  considered  at  that  time  a  greater  calamity
to  be  subjugated  by  a  fellow  republic  than  by  a  monarchy;
inasmuch  as  princes  brought  their  tyranny  to  bear  equally
on  all  alike,  and  thus,  at  any  rate  as  regarded  politics,  the
chief  majority  of  the  conquered  suffered  less  injury.
When  Florence,  however,  by  achieving  the  long-desired
conquest  of  Pisa,  at  last  became  mistress  of  the  sea,  and
witnessed  the  rapid  increase  of  her  commerce,  she  dis-
covered that  the  annexation  of  a  great  and  powerful
republic,  full  of  life  and  strength  and  possessed  of  so
large  a  trade,  brought  her  none  of  the  advantages  which
might  have  ensued  from  a  union  of  a  freer  kind  with  an
equal  distribution  of  political  rights.  The  chief  citizens
of  Pisa  and  all  the  wealthier  families  left  the  country,
preferring  to  live  in  Lombard y,  France,  or  even  in  Sicily
under  the  Aragonese,  where  at  least  they  enjoyed  civil
equality,  rather  than  remain  in  their  own  city  subject  to
the  harsh  and  tyrannous  rule  of  Florentine  shopkeepers.
The  commerce  and  industry  of  Pisa,  her  navy,  her
merchant-fleet,  all  vanished  when  freedom  fell  ;  while
her  Studio^  or  university,  one  of  the  old  glories  of  Italy,
and  afterwards  reconstituted  by  the  Medici,  was  done
away  with,  and  the  city  soon  reduced  to  a  state  of  squalid
desolation.  All  conquered  cities  suffered  this  fate  ;  those
once  of  the  richest  and  most  powerful  in  the  days  of  their
freedom  being  treated  with  still  greater  harshness  than
the  rest.  I     This  makes  it  easy  to  understand  why,  when

statements  are  to  be  found  in  this  work.  In  treating  of  chap.  xii.  bk.  i.,
where  Machiavelli  charges  the  Popes  with  having  prevented  the  unity  of
Italy,  the  author  qualifies  his  approval  of  the  remark  by  adding :  "  But
I  feel  uncertain  whether  it  were  a  good  or  an  ill  chance  for  this  province


358  THE  GREATER  GUILDS.

Florence  was  in  danger,  all  conquered  cities  in  which  life
was  not  altogether  extinguished  invariably  seized  the
opportunity  to  try  to  regain  their  independence,  and
always  preferred  a  native  or  foreign  tyrant  to  cowering
beneath  the  yoke  of  a  republic  that  refused  to  learn  from
experience  the  wisdom  of  changing  its  policy.  Nor  could
it  have  effected  such  change  without  radically  altering  its
whole  constitution  and  manner  of  existence.

Thus,  in  accumulating  riches  and  power,  Florence  was
only  multiplying  the  causes  of  her  approaching  and  un-
avoidable decline.  The  Commune  seemed  increasingly
incapable  of  giving  birth  to  the  modern  State,  and  accord-
ingly, when  its  chief  support,  commerce,  began  to  decay,
the  strength  of  the  burghers  was  sapped,  and  the  op-
pressed multitude,  now  a  formidable  majority,  speedily
looked  to  monarchical  rule  for  their  relief.  Thus  the
Medici  were  enabled  to  attain  supremacy  in  the  name  of
freedom,  and  with  the  support  of  people  and  populace.
Thus,  likewise,  by  violence,  or  fraud,  or  by  both  combined,
the  communes  of  Italy  were  all  reduced  to  principalities;
and  wherever,  from  exceptional  causes,  the  republican
order  still  lingered  on  for  a  while,  it  was  only  as  a  shadow
of  its  former  self,  and  no  longer  rendering  any  of  the
advantages  for  which  it  had  been  originally  designed.
Populations  which  had  failed  to  establish  equality  by
means  of  free  institutions,  were  now  forced  to  learn  the
lesson  of  equality  beneath  the  undiscriminating  oppression
of  a  despotic  prince.     Signories  formed  the  necessary  link

to  escape  being  absorbed  in  a  kingdom  ;  for  although  to  be  subject  to  a
republic  might  prove  a  glory  to  the  name  of  Italy  and  a  happiness  to  the
dominant  city,  it  could  only  bring  calamity  to  all  other  cities,  seeing  that,
oppressed  by  the  latter's  shadow,  they  were  unable  to  rise  to  any  great-
ness, it  being  the  wont  of  republics  *  to  give  no  share  of  the  fruits  of  their
independence  and  power  to  any  save  their  own  citizens.  .  .  .  This  reason
does  not  hold  good  in  a  monarchy  wherein  all  subjects  enjoy  more
equality,  and  therefore  we  behold  France  and  many  other  provinces
living  contentedly  under  a  king.'"

of  transition  between  the  mediaeval  commune  and  the
modern  state.  For  these  Signories  traced  a  way  towards
the  just  administration  and  method  pursued  by  the  vast
kingdoms  then  in  course  of  formation  on  the  continent  of
Europe,  and  which  also  remained  absolute  and  despotic
monarchies  until  the  French  revolution  effected  in  town,
country,  and  throughout  every  class  that  work  of  social
emancipation  which  the  Italian  communes  had  so  admir-
ably initiated,  but  had  never  learnt  to  extend  beyond  the
circuit  of  their  walls.

Florence  maintained  a  prolonged  resistance,  but  finally
shared  the  fate  of  her  fellow  republics.

T  is  certain  that  no  real  national  history
of  ItaJy  can  be  written  until  the  statutes
and  laws  of  our  communes  have  been
published,  studied,  and  thoroughly  in-
vestigated by  the  light  not  merely  of
historical  but  of  legal  research.  The
necessity  for  such  investigation  was  first  proclaimed  by  the

"  To  avoid  the  addition  of  too  many  notes  to  a  chapter  treating  of  the
general  course  of  events,  and  only  purposing  to  throw  some  light  on  the
political  conditions  of  our  communes,  more  especially  of  Florence,  I  may
say  once  for  all,  that  besides  the  statutes,  quoted  in  due  place,  the
authorities  most  frequently  referred  to  are  :  Savigny,  "  Storia  del  Diritto
Romano  nel  Medio  Evo  "  ;  Francesco  Forti,  "  Istituzioni  Civili  e  Trattati
inediti  di  giurisprudenza  "  ;  Gans,  "  II  Diritto  di  Successione  nella  Storia

At  this  date  it  is  scarcely  necessary  to  remark  that  since  1868  these
studies  have  made  enormous  progress  in  Italy,  and  that  many  works  of
signal  importance  have  been  produced  which  were  naturally  unknown  to
me  while  engaged  on  these  pages,  only  intended — at  the  moment — to  assist
my  pupils  to  a  clearer  comprehension  of  the  Florentine  revolution  of
1293,  and  the  "Ordinamenti  di  Giustizia,"  which  were  its  inevitable  and
long  needed  results.

THE  VALUE  OF  OLD  LAWS  AND  STATUTES.    361

learned  Savigny,  subsequently  recognised  by  many  Italian
scholars,  but  has  never  yet  been  entirely  satisfied.  An
accurate  study  of  those  old  laws  and  statutes  would  make
us  acquainted  with  the  public  law  of  the  communes,  and
place  before  our  eyes  a  clear  and  exact  picture  of  their
political  institutions  which  have  been  hitherto  very
imperfectly  understood.  Moreover,  what  is  certainly  of
no  less  importance — it  would  enlarge  our  knowledge  of
our  ancient  private  law,  to  which  many  learned  authorities,
among  others  Francesco  Forti,  attribute  the  origin  of
modern  jurisprudence,  and  the  germs  of  many  jural
provisions,  afterwards  accepted  by  us  as  novelties  derived
from  the  French  Code.

Public  and  private  law  have  far  more  affinity  than  is
generally  supposed,  and  each  conduces  to  the  plainer  and
more  exact  comprehension  of  the  other.  Society  and  the
State  have  both  their  birth  in  the  family,  reacting  upon
and  modifying  it  in  turn.  No  student  therefore  who
seeks  to  discover  the  true  key  to  political  institutions
developing  themselves  in  a  country  spontaneously,  should
neglect  the  constitution  of  the  family  wherein  are  to  be
found  the  earliest  beginnings  of  civil  law,  with  which
political  law  also  is  more  or  less  connected.  Cases,  it  is
true,  frequently  occur  of  one  people  adopting  the  civil
law  of  another,  without  altering  its  own  political  institu-
tions ;  while  in  other  instances  both  are  imposed  simul-
taneously by  a  superior  foreign  force.  This  has  led  many
to  question  the  reality  of  the  connection  which  in  fact
subsists  between  them.  But  these  cases  have  nothing  to
do  with  that  natural  and  spontaneous  development  of  law
of  which    we   are    now  speaking.     In  this  development,

362    FAMIL  Y  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES.

politics  and  jurisprudence,  the  State  and  the  family,  are
found  to  be  closely  interconnected.

In  the  course  of  Florentine  history  we  often  see
political  revolutions  break  out  suddenly  and  apparently
without  warning  ;  but  on  closer  examination  we  perceive
them  to  be  the  result  of  deep  social  changes  which  have
been  maturing  for  a  long  time,  and  although  imper-
ceptible at  first,  afterwards  assuming  such  proportions  as
to  become  suddenly  visible  to  all  eyes  and  productive  of
political  reforms.  Thus  it  happens  that  private  law,  which
always  accompanies  social  movements  and  changes  with
them,  not  unfrequently  enables  us  to  trace  the  sources
and  unfold  the  true  tendency  and  inexorable  necessity  of
revolutions,  even  before  they  come  to  pass.  Accordingly,
the  habitual  neglect  of  this  particular  study  in  connection
with  the  history  of  Italy  has  proved  a  serious  defect.  No
one  at  the  present  day  would  venture  to  write  the  political
history  of  Rome  without  giving  attention  to  the  Roman
jurisprudence.  Nevertheless,  we  have  written  the  history
of  our  republics  over  and  over  again,  without  bestowing
a  thought  on  their  civil  and  penal  legislation.

It  is  true  that  the  investigation  required  presents  very
great  difficulties,  inasmuch  as  our  history  was  subject,
during  the  Middle  Ages,  to  a  series  of  changes,  always
rapid  and  always  different.  The  number  of  our  republics
is  infinite.  Every  province  of  Italy,  every  fragment  of
Italian  territory  is  divided  and  subdivided  into  communes,
every  one  of  which  has  a  distinct  history,  and  political
institutions  which  are  constantly  changing.  This  per-
petual mutation  is  faithfully  reflected  in  the  statutes  of  the
Commune,  On  the  margins  of  these  statutes  we  find
alterations  and  corrections  registered  from  year  to  year,
and  formulated,  not  unfrequently,  after  the  streets  of  the
city  had  begun  to  run  with  blood.  When  annotations
and  corrections  reach  a  certain  number,  the  statutes  are


CONDITION  OF  THE  ROMAN  LA  W  AND  TAMIL  K    363

drafted  anew,  and  of  these  re-drafts  also  many  copies  are
still  extant.  It  was  the  duty  of  the  officials  in  charge  of
the  statutes  {jtatutart)  to  enter  from  time  to  time  such
farther  modifications  as  were  afterwards  approved  of  in
the  Councils  of  the  People.  Hence  it  sometimes  happens
that  on  referring  to  the  statutes  of  a  given  year,  we  may
find  the  duties  of  some  chief  magistrate  of  the  Republic
set  forth  in  their  text  with  the  most  minute  detail,  whereas
if  we  look  to  the  notes  it  will  appear  that  these  duties
have  already  been  changed.  If  we  next  consult  the  re-
modelled statute  it  will  be  found  that  the  magistracy
itself  no  longer  exists.  How  is  it  possible,  therefore,  to
give  any  idea  of  the  political  form  of  a  municipality
fashioned  in  such  wise  ?  This  can  only  be  done  by
gleaning  from  the  mass  of  the  statutes  the  history  of  the
constitution  through  all  its  successive  changes  of  form.
In  a  word,  we  must  recognise  that,  instead  of  being  con-
fronted by  a  system  crystallised,  fixed  and  immutable,
we  are  watching  a  living  organism  develop  under  our
eyes  in  obedience  to  a  settled  law.  This  law  alone  is
uniform,  and  it  is  this  we  must  endeavour  to  trace,  since
it  alone  can  solve  the  mystery  and  supply  exact  ideas.
Turning  from  public  law  to  private  legislation,  our
difficulties  rather  increase  than  diminish.  For,  in  per-
using this,  by  no  means  less  important  portion  of  the
statutes,  we  come  upon  a  confused  medley  of  legal
systems  differing  from  and  often  opposed  to  one  another.
When  we  meet  with  such  terms  as  meta  and  mundium^

succession  and  succession  by  agreement,  we  recognise
that  Longobard  law,  Roman  law,  feudal  law,  and  canon

in  constantly  varying  proportions.  These  diverse  legal
systems  act  and  react  one  upon  the  other,  producing

constantly  filtering  which  indubitably  belong  to  the
Longobard  law,  while  the  latter  in  its  turn  is  profoundly
modified  ("  mutilated  and  castrated,"  as  Gans  expresses
it)  by  the  Roman  law.  How  are  we  to  explain  this
congeries  of  different  laws  ?  Is  there  any  new  and
original  principle  that  assimilates  the  heterogeneous
elements  and  constitutes  a  new  law  ?  If  so,  what  is  it  ?
This  is  the  knotty  problem  which  Savigny  encouraged  us
to  attack,  but  which  we  have  hitherto  failed  to  unravel.  But
although  the  question  remains  unsolved,  its  importance
is  now  universally  acknowledged  ;  it  has  been  carefully
studied,  and  many  treatises,  including  some  of  the  highest
value,  have  been  published  on  the  subject.  Accordingly
certain  observations  may  at  last  be  offered  to  the  public.

The  constitution  of  the  family  and  its  relation  with
the  State  are,  as  it  were,  the  chief  centre  round  which  all
fresh  researches  must  revolve,  and  these  form  the  subject
of  this  short  and  summary  essay.  As  a  preliminary
step  towards  the  solution  of  the  problem,  an  accurate
investigation  is  required  of  the  various  forms  that  the
family  assumed  under  the  various  systems  of  law  which
succeeded  one  another  in  Italy,  in  order  to  ascertain  how
it  was  that  from  the  combination  of  those  various  forms,
another  and  widely  different  one  should  have  resulted.
The  first  question  therefore  that  presents  itself  has  refer-
ence to  the  condition  of  the  Roman  law  and  the  Roman
family  at  the  time  of  the  barbarian  invasion.  As  regards
the  Italian  communes,  it  is  only  natural  that  the  Roman
jurisprudence  should  strike  the  deepest  and  strongest  root
in  their  social  system,  and  that  the  history  of  our  laws
should  originally  find  in  it  their  first  beginning.  Here,
however,  we  are  forced  to  enter  on  a  digression  which,
although  seemingly  apart  from  the  point,  will  presently
help  us  to  a  clearer  understanding  of  the  new  society  in
course  of  development.     With  regard  to  this  digression


EVOLUTION  OF  THE  ROMAN  JURISPRUDENCE.  365

it  should  also  be  said  that  so  much  learning  and  research
have  been  directed  to  the  study  of  Roman  law,  that  we
are  able  to  arrive  at  certain  trustworthy  conclusions  which,
by  affording  evidence  of  the  close  connection  between  the
Roman  family,  and  the  political  society  derived  from  it,
will  show  us  what  path  to  take  in  pursuit  of  the  same
connection  in  the  history  of  Italy.


II.

Every  student  of  the  Pandects  knows  that  the  words
"  Roman  law "  denote  the  outcome  of  long  preliminary
labours,  and  the  ultimate  form  of  a  jurisprudence  which
cannot  be  rightly  understood  without  analysing  all  the
historical  elements  employed  in  preparing  and  building  it
up.  Treated  in  this  way,  the  history  of  Roman  law
becomes,  as  it  were,  instantly  transformed  into  a  history
of  many  different  legislations  following  one  another  at
intervals.  From  the  Twelve  Tables  down  to  Justinian,
this  law  never  halts  for  an  hour  in  its  constant  course  of
development.  Even  during  the  Middle  Ages,  when  the
compilations  made  at  Constantinople  were  studied  with
religious  zeal  by  expounders  and  commentators  whose  sole
object  was  to  faithfully  reproduce  and  diffuse  this  law,
even  thus,  in  the  hands  of  those  interpreters,  influenced
by  the  altered  spirit  of  the  times  and  by  new  social
developments,  it  underwent  changes  of  which  they  were
not  themselves  conscious.  It  is  not  until  the  fifteenth
century  that  this  historic  development  can  be  said  to  have
ceased  among  us,  and  Roman  law  become  mainly  a  subject
of  learned  research.  It  is  at  this  time  that  a  new  and
modern  system  of  jurisprudence  first  reveals  itself  to
history,  endowed  with  a  separate  life,  and  with  a  form  of  its
own,  though  borrowing  much  from  the  Roman  law,  which


366    FAMILY  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES.

in  consequence  continues  to  be  of  the  utmost  value  to
us,  and  still  deserves  our  most  assiduous  attention,
although  for  a  very  different  purpose  from  that  with
which  it  was  studied  during  the  Middle  Ages.  Our
object  is  now  to  familiarise  ourselves  with  an  immortal
monument  of  ancient  wisdom,  to  shape  our  legal  edu-
cation by  it,  to  be  helped  by  it  to  a  clearer  under-
standing of  our  own  codes,  and  to  contemplate  it  in  its
successive  manifestations,  while  we  search  for  its  regulating
law.  It  is  in  fact  the  discovery  of  this  law  that  has  at
once  thrown  a  new  light  upon  the  whole  history  of  Roman
jurisprudence,  which  we  perceive  to  have  been  always  and
unceasingly  governed  by  it,  and  thus  forced  to  assume  a
character  so  constant  and  continuous  through  all  its  various
transformations,  that  what  had  before  seemed  to  be  a  series
of  distinct  legislations  takes  an  entirely  new  aspect,  making
us  spectators,  as  it  were,  of  the  evolution  of  a  single  idea,
the  progressive  development  of  a  work  of  Nature.

All  this  continuous  progress  or  evolution  was  the  result
of  two  forces,  of  two  different  elements.  The  true,  primi-
tive law  of  Rome  was  the  special  law  of  the  Quirites,  of
which  we  find  the  remains  in  the  Twelve  Tables :  a  severe
and  restricted  law  abounding  in  formulas  v/hich  had  to
be  sacredly  observed,  and  its  administration  was  entrusted
to  a  small  number  of  citizens  who  alone  were  acquainted
with  its  rules,  whose  authority  was  sanctioned  by  religion.
The  smallest  mistake  of  form  made  void  the  most  just
decree,  and  where  the  law  omitted  to  define  the  formula
to  be  observed,  no  valid  action  could  be  brought.  When
the  due  formula,  making  the  contract  binding,  had  once
been  pronounced,  no  proof  of  mistake  or  fraud  could
annul  it.  "  Uti  lingua  nuncupassit  ita  ius  esto."  A  slave
to  forms,  the  judge  could  not  listen  to  the  voice  of
morality  or  rectitude  ;  the  most  just  complaint  failed  to
move   him,  unless   supported   by  a  text   of  law.      The


MODIFICATION  OF  THE  ROMAN  LA  W.        367

defendant  dared  not  stir  a  step  without  the  continual
guidance  of  the  legislator,  inasmuch  as  every  juridical
formula  was  sacred  and  inviolable  ;  and  as  the  science  of
law  was  monopolised  by  the  College  of  Pontiffs,  the  most
aristocratic  and  conservative  body  in  Rome,  it  became  a
kind  of  occult  science.  It  was  this  very  character,  how-
ever, apparently  so  restricted  and  pedantic,  that  gave  its
great  force  to  the  law  in  Rome.  For  law,  being  now  freed
for  the  first  time  from  every  extraneous  element  belonging
to  morals  and  good  faith,  became  firm  and  inexorable.
Any  one  who  had  the  law  in  his  favour  was  safe  to  see  it
promptly  carried  out.  History  affords  no  example  else-
where of  legal  sanction  and  redress  being  applied  so
swiftly  and  surely  as  in  Rome.  In  Athens,  indeed,  where
the  laws  were  more  philosophical,  and  the  popular
conscience  gave  judgment,  investigating  motives,  despising
formulas,  and  looking  only  to  substantial  justice,  caprice
often  prevailed,  and  law  never  attained  the  iron  strength
and  tenacity  of  the  Roman  jurisprudence.

But  with  changing  times,  all  things  changed  in  Rome.
This  jurisprudence  revered  as  sacred,  but  described  by
Vico  as  made  up  of  formulas  and  phrases^  was  well  adapted
to  a  rude  and  primitive  people.  Ideas  had  greatly  altered
in  the  days  of  Cicero,  who  in  his  speech  pro  Murena
severely  satirises  a  science  which,  in  his  eyes,  had  become
ridiculous  :  "  res  enim  sunt  parvae,  prope  in  singulis  Uteris
atque  interpunctionibus  occupatas."  He  looked  upon  the
whole  thing  as  a  fraud  designed  by  the  priests  to  secure
themselves  a  monopoly.  Was  he  in  the  right  or  the
wrong  ,?  Vico,  in  examining  a  similar  question,  showed
that  Cicero  was  mistaken  on  this  score.  Cicero  and  his
contemporaries,  he  said,  lived  in  too  cultivated  an  age  to
comprehend  rude  and  primitive  jurisprudence  ;  they  could
not  grasp  its  true  significance,  but  formed  their  judgment
of  the  ancient  laws  according  to  the  ideas  arwi  principles


368    FAMILY  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES.

of  their  own  times.  This  view,  which  was  first  broached
in  the  Scienza  Nuova^  was  afterwards  accepted  by  many
other  writers  ;  and  it  is  now  placed  beyond  a  doubt  that
the  primitive  Roman  law  was  not  the  artifice  of  a  learned
few,  but  was  a  spontaneous  and  necessary  growth  among
the  people  with  whom  it  had  its  origin.  At  first,  custom,
clearly  distinguished  from  the  law  formulated  and  written,
tempered  its  rigid  severity.  Good  faith  and  equity,  dis-
regarded and  rejected  by  the  law,  found  their  sanction  in
custom,  were  administered  by  a  separate  tribunal,  and
were  always  respected,  inasmuch  as  the  sentence  pro-
nounced by  the  officiating  magistrate  was  morally,  though
not  legally,  binding,  and  was  therefore  of  great  efficacy  as
the  genuine  expression  of  public  opinion.  The  sentence
of  condemnation  could  not  be  carried  out  by  force  ;  but
it  made  the  condemned  man  infamous,  and,  as  a  last  resort,
the  magistrate  could  cite  the  accused  before  the  people,  as
the  supreme  legislator  and  judge.

But  at  a  later  date  customs  grew  corrupt,  and  no  longer
sufficed  to  protect  public  good  faith  and  morality,  which
were  driven  to  seek,  asylum  and  sanction  in  the  law,  and
so  began  gradually  to  modify  its  primitive  character.
Substance  now  prevailed  over  form,  equity  over  the
ancient  text  of  the  law,  the  intention  of  the  contracting
parties  over  words  uttered  by  mistake  ;  the  law  became
more  moral  as  customs  grew  more  degraded.  This  trans-
formation, though  very  gradual  at  the  beginning,  was
afterward,  accelerated  by  the  new  conditions  of  the
Republics  in  which  a  change  took  place  not  unlike  that
occurring  in  the  history  of  jurisprudence,  towards  the
beginning  of  the  seventeenth  century.  At  that  time  the
various  European  States,  with  their  various  systems  of
law,  having  contracted  new  relations  with  one  another,
came  to  recognise  the  necessity  of  establishing  some  fixed
rules  by  which  all  should  be  bound,  and  thus,  under  the


FUSION  OF  LEGAL  SYSTEMS.  369

auspices  of  Hugh  Grotius,  the  so-called  School  of  Natural
Law  was  built  up.  The  same  occurred  in  Rome,  if  not
in  the  science,  at  any  rate  in  the  practice  of  law.  As  the
dominion  of  the  Republic  became  extended  in  Italy,  its  re-
lations increased  with  neighbouring  nations,  among  whom
the  more  philosophical  and  less  severe  laws  and  principles
of  the  Greek  jurisprudence  prevailed.  It  was  impossible
to  impose  upon  all  these  nations,  without  modification,
the  rigid  law  of  the  Roman  patriciate.  Accordingly  a
new  system  of  law,  of  a  simpler  character  and  wider
reach,  took  shape  and  rapidly  grew.  This  was  named  the
jus  gentium^  to  distinguish  it  from  the  other,  the  jus
civile.  "  Jus  gentium  est  quod  naturalis  ratio  inter  omnes
homJnes  constituit."  This  system,  however,  was  not
deduced  from  philosophic  theories  concerning  human
nature,  as  was  the,  appropriately  styled,  natural  law  of
the  eighteenth  century ;  it  originated  in  the  practical
needs  of  the  Romans  and  their  new  relations  with  other
Italian  peoples  :  it  was  fostered  by  the  principles  of  Greek
jurisprudence  that  had  been  transplanted  into  Southern
Italy  ;  it  met  the  new  requirements  of  the  Romans  them-
selves ;  and  taking  the  place  that  custom  had  previously
filled  in  the  Roman  courts,  grew  side  by  side  with  the  law
of  the  Patricians  with  which  it  long  maintained  its  union.
There  were  thus  two  systems  of  law  in  force  in  Rome  ;
and  we  accordingly  find  on  the  one  hand  judges  and  courts
faithful  to  the  ancient  formalism,  on  the  other,  judges  and
courts  taking  cognizance  of  equity  and  good  faith,  and
almost  discharging  the  duties  of  the  Censor.  The  con-
tinuous onward  progress  of  iht  Jus  geniium,  the  reciprocal
action  of  the  two  legal  systems  ultimately  fusing  them  into
one,  wherein  the  old  Roman  formation  gradually  lost  its
rigidity,  and  equity,  becoming  incorporated  with  the  civil
law,  began  to  assume  a  more  definite  and  regular  form,
were  all  consequences  of  the  principle  which  dominates  the

25


370    FAMILY  AND  STAIE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES.

life  and  history  of  the  Roman  law,  and  may  even  be  said
to  constitute  it.  For  it  has  been  moulded  and  diffused
through  the  world,  inheriting  from  the  old  Quirites  its
frame  of  iron  ;  from  contact  with  other  races  and  from  such
germs  as  it  could  assimilate  of  Greek  civilisation,  its  more
comprehensive  and  human  spirit.  Assuming  thus  a  cha-
racter at  once  exact  and  philosophical,  it  seemed  as  though
destined  to  become,  from  its  superiority,  the  universal
jurisprudence,  the  indispensable  foundation,  as  it  were,  of
all  future  legislation.  This  union  of  legal  systems  was
effected  by  the  Prastor.  He  it  was  who  represented  both
the  modern  spirit  and  the  ancient,  enlarging  the  old  law
with  the  defences  of  equity  which  he  strengthened  by  sub-
mitting it  to  the  trammels  of  a  formal  procedure.  This
in  substance  was  what  took  place  with  regard  to  customs,
letters,  and  everything  else.  The  fusion  of.  Greek  civili-
sation with  the  Roman  constitutes  the  history  of  the  ancient
world.

III.

As  is  natural,  we  also  meet  with  the  same  phenomena  in
the  history  of  the  family,  from  which  the  civil  law  is  to
a  great  extent  derived.  In  fact,  whoever  contemplates  the
primitive  Roman  family,  at  once  recognises  it  as  the  basis
upon  which  the  future  juridical  and  political  greatness  ot
Rome  was  erected.  The  family  is  sacred  ;  the  father  is
absolute  master  of  the  goods,  the  liberty  and  the  life
both  of  his  wife  and  of  his  children.  He  is  priest,  judge,
supreme  arbiter  :  wife,  children,  and  grandchildren  form
with  him  a  single  joint  society,  one  legal  entity  of  which
he  is  the  representative.  The  woman  may  be  bartered
away,  killed,  or  sold  in  execution  ;  freed  by  marriage  from
the  despotic  control  of  her  father,  she  at  once  falls  under
that  of  her  husband  ;  her  legal  incapacity  lasts  through  her


PERPETUAL  TUTELAGE  OF  WOMEN         371.

whole  life.  But  primitive  customs  so  temper  this  harsh
law  that  we  find  no  other  people  of  antiquity  so  observant
of  the  sanctity  of  family,  or  showing  so  much  respect  to
woman.  Matrimony  is  styled  "  consortium  omnis  vitae,
divini  et  humani  iuris  communicatio."  Divorce  on  the  part
of  the  husband  {reptidiuni)  is  not  forbidden  by  law,  but
any  man  who  repudiates  his  wife  is  dishonoured  by  the
Censor,  excommunicated  by  the  priest,  and  for  a  period  of
five  centuries  few  cases  of  repudiation  are  recorded.  In
ancient  Greece  some  traces  of  oriental  polygamy  are  still
discernible,  but  in  Italy  monogamy  is  coeval  with  Rome
itself.  Natural  children,  as  such,  never  rank  as  members
of  the  family,  but  they  may  be  legitimated.  Adop-
tion is  a  solemn  act,  the  moral  propriety  of  which  is
referred  to  the  decision  of  the  pontifex,  as  the  guardian
of  the  sanctity  of  the  family,  and  is  thus  submitted
to  the  popular  sanction.  The  woman  is  never  seen  in
places  of  public  resort,  nor  does  she  attend  popular  gather-
ing ;  but  within  doors  she  is  domina^  and  the  husband
addresses  her  by  that  title.  The  Atrium  is  the  centre  and
sanctuary  of  the  house.  Here  relations,  friends,  and
strangers  meet  together  ;  here  stand  the  domestic  hearth,
the  altar  dedicated  to  the  Lares^  and  all  those  objects  which
the  family  holds  sacred  :  the  nuptial  coach,  the  ancestral
likenesses  moulded  in  wax  from  the  faces  of  the  dead,  the
matron's  rock  and  spindle,  the  chest  containing  the  house-
hold records  and  monies.  All  these  possessions  are  en-
trusted to  the  care  and  superintendence  of  the  mother  of
the  family,  who,  together  with  her  husband,  sacrifices  to
the  gods  and  assists  him  in  the  management  of  the  com-
mon patrimony :  she  directs  all  domestic  work,  and
watches  over  the  education  of  her  children.  In  the
annals  and  legends  of  Rome  the  name  of  some  heroine,
such  as  Virginia  or  Lucretia,  is  indissolubly  linked  with
the  chief  glories  of  the  Eternal  City.     It  is  not  so  in


372    FA  MIL  Y  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES.

Greece.  In  instituting  and  sanctifying  the  family,  the
Romans  laid  the  foundation-stone  of  the  Capitol.  But  to
maintain  this  primitive  nucleus  of  Roman  society  firm  and
compact,  the  law  must  always  watch  with  vigilance  and
multiply  its  ordinances.  The  property  of  the  family
must  be  kept  together  as  strictly  as  possible  and  for  the
longest  possible  time.  The  father  is  its  sole  master  and
arbiter  ;  but  on  his  death  the  patrimony  is  equally  divided
between  sons  and  daughters.  The  unity  of  the  family
must  also  be  guarded  and  defended  by  the  law,  since  there
is  serious  danger  that  a  woman  marrying  may  carry  away
from  the  family  an  interest  in  the  family  property.  She  is
accordingly  subjected  by  the  law  to  a  perpetual  tutelage
which  prevents  her  from  disposing  at  will  of  her  own
property.  On  the  death  of  her  father  the  woman  comes
under  the  tutelage  of  the  agnati.  In  Cicero's  day,  when
as  Vico  has  noted,  the  true  significance  of  primitive
Roman  law  had  been  lost,  lawyers  believed  that  this  tute-
lage of  women  had  been  established  on  account  of  the
weakness  of  the  sex,  'proper  sexus  infirmitatem.  But
Gaius  refers  to  this  opinion  as  a  plausible  and  prevaleni:
error,  and  maintains  that  the  restriction  was  instituted  in
the  interest  of  the  agnati,  so  that  the  woman,  whose  pre-
sumptive heirs  they  were,  should  have  no  power  to  alienate,
diminish,  or  otherwise  defraud  them  of  their  inheritance,  ^
So  long  as  the  woman  remained  under  the  tutelage  of
her  father,  inasmuch  as  she  had  not  yet  inherited,  the  law
allowed  her  to  incur  legal  obligations.  The  danger  for  the
family  began  when,  on  her  father's  death,  she  became  an  I
heir.  It  was  from  that  precise  moment,  accordingly,  that
she  came  under  the  tutelage  of  her  own  heirs  the  agnati,  and
could  no  longer  bind  herself  without  their  consent.  This
tutelage,  therefore,  became  not  merely  a  duty  on  the  part
of  the  agnati,  but  was  also  a  right  and  privilege.     Where

'  Gaius,  i,  pp,  890-2.


CHANGES  INTRODUCED  IN  CESAR'S  TIME.     373

the  agnate  was  a  minor,  of  weak  mind,  or  otherwise  inca-
pacitated, he  did  not  forfeit  this  right,  but  it  had  to  be
exercised  by  a  third  party.  The  tutor  fixed  the  dowry  to  be
given  with  the  woman  on  her  marriage  ;  but  the  remainder
of  her  patrimony  had  to  be  preserved  intact,  that  it  might
return  afterwards  to  the  agnati.  No  woman  could  make
a  will,  that  she  might  not  have  it  in  her  power  to  defraud
the  family.  On  passing  in  manus  viri,  the  woman  under-
went a  capitis  diminutio.  She  entered  another  family,  as
it  were,  loco  filia^  and  her  new  relations  became  her  law-
ful heirs.  Under  these  circumstances  the  law  permitted
her  to  make  a  testamentary  disposition,  whereby,  notwith-
standing her  new  relationships,  she  might  restore  her
patrimony  to  her  own  original  family.

When  the  woman  was  under  the  manus  of  her  husband,
she  was  emancipated  from  the  paternal  authority  and  from
the  tutelage  of  her  agnates.  The  displeasure  thereby
caused  to  her  own  family  was  so  great  that,  before  long,
marriage  by  simple  consent  was  resorted  to,  according  to
which  the  woman  became  personally  subject  to  her  hus-
band's authority,  but  he  had  no  right  of  manus  over  her,
and  consequently  no  power  over  her  property.  In  this
way  the  woman  remained  under  the  power  of  her  father
or  of  the  agnates,  and  at  the  same  time  came  under  the
authority  of  her  husband,  an  arrangement  that  inevitably
led  to  many  collisions,  and  hastened  the  advent  of  the
most  radical  change  in  the  Roman  family — the  complete
independence  of  woman.  But,  before  reaching  this  point,
disputes  were  for  a  long  time  kept  in  check  and  effica-
ciously remedied  by  the  mediating  influence  of  a  most
important  institution — the  domestic  tribunal.  This  family
council,  regulated  by  usage,  not  law,  was  composed  of
agnates,  cognates,  relations,  and  sometimes  also  of  friends.
It  presided  at  espousals  and  at  the  assumption  of  the  toga
virilis ;  it  protected  orphans  ;   it  aided  the  head  of  the

family  in  adjudicating  and  in  awarding  punishment,  and
acted  as  a  restraint  on  his  authority.  By  law,  the  father
could  act  even  without  the  co-operation  of  the  Council ;
but  by  doing  so,  he  exposed  himself  to  being  publicly
blamed  and  noted  with  ignominy  by  the  Censor,  who,
if  necessary,  might  accuse  him  before  the  people.  The
marriageable  maiden  was  subject  to  and  protected  by  this
Council.

Becoming  a  wife  by  that  form  of  marriage  which
brought  her  in  manus  viri^  she  left  her  own  family  to
become  member  of  another  ;  but  if  not  married  under
that  form,  she  still  remained  subject  to  the  family  Council,
in  which  her  husband  was  now  included.


IV.

In  the  age  of  Caesar,  the  Roman  family  Is  no  longer
what  it  was  at  first.  Laws,  usages,  ideas,  all  are  changed  ;
and  everything  is  moving  onward  to  a  still  more  radical
transformation.  The  jus  gentium  seems  to  have  become
identical  with  the  more  rigorous  jus  civile.  The  fidei-
commissum  has  almost  the  force  of  a  testament  in  solemn
form,  and  has  become  part,  as  it  were,  of  the  jus  civile ;
verbal  contract^  the  ancient  stipulation  once  so  hampered
by  formulas,  is  grown  so  flexible  as  to  resemble  a  contract
under  the  jus  gentium.  But  the  greatest  change  of  all  has
taken  place  in  the  family.  The  domestic  hearth  is  no
longer  the  household  sanctuary.  The  Atrium  is  trans-
formed into  an  open  courtyard,  enlivened  with  flowers
and  limpid  fountains,  ornamented  with  gilded  busts  and
statues,  often  of  an  obscene  character.  Sacrifices  are  no
longer  offered  there  to  the  gods  amid  the  stillness  and
purity  of  domestic  and  religious  afi^ection  ;  it  now  serves
the  enriched  and  corrupt  patrician  as  a  place  of  reception

for  his  numerous  friends  and  clients.  The  family  of
former  days,  once  almost  a  State  within  the  State,  is  now
dissolved,  and,  as  it  were,  swallowed  up  by  the  political
power.  The  agnates  no  longer  cleave  together,  the
domestic  tribunal  has  either  lost  its  strength  or  has
entirely  disappeared.  Paternal  authority,  though  less
absolute,  is  more  oppressive,  being  no  longer  in  harmony
with  the  changed  customs.  If  a  father  disinherits  his  son,
the  judge  cancels  the  will.  Should  he  refuse  consent  to
his  son's  marriage,  the  State  compels  him  to  grant  it  ;
should  he  punish  his  son  with  death,  the  emperor  sends
him  into  exile  ;  he  cannot  ill-use  even  his  slaves  without
being  punished  by  the  law,  for  the  law  has  grown  moral
as  manners  become  more  corrupt.  By  gradual  degrees
woman  escapes  from  tutelage,  and  from  manus^  and
ultimately  attains  her  independence.  But  the  more  she
is  emancipated  from  her  family  and  relations,  the  greater
becomes  her  subjection  to  the  State.  In  her  new  inde-
pendence she  incurs  new  disabilities,  no  longer  resulting
from  her  position  as  daughter  or  wife,  but  from  the  fact
of  her  sex,  disabilities  no  longer  imposed  in  the  interest
of  the  family,  but  created  as  a  protection  for  her  infirmity.
This  explains  how  it  was  that  the  lawyers  of  later  days
were  mistaken  as  to  the  significance  of  the  old  law  touching
the  tutela  of  woman.  The  wife's  dowry  is  guaranteed  to
her  more  and  more  strictly,  until  it  finally  becomes  her
almost  inseparable  property.  It  must  neither  be  alienated
nor  diminished.  On  her  becoming  a  widow,  being
divorced,  or  returning  to  the  paternal  roof,  she  remains
absolute  mistress  of  it.  A  husband  who  surprises  his  wife
in  adultery  can  no  longer — hiding  his  dishonour  within
his  own  walls — judge  and  put  her  to  death  with  the
consent  of  the  domestic  tribunal.  He  must  now  leave
the  State  to  avenge  his  wrongs,  and  must  resort  to  the
courts,  even  though  seeking  only  minor  penalties.    Divorce


376    FAMILY  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES.

has  become  a  public  act  of  not  unfrequent  occurrence.
The  woman,  in  short,  is  no  longer  under  her  husband's
manuSy  no  longer  subject  to  the  patria  -potestas^  no  longer
under  the  tutelage  of  the  agnati :  she  is  protected  by  the
State.  When  the  law  still  requires  her  to  have  a  tutor
or  procurator,  she  can  choose  a  stranger  who  becomes  her
servant  rather  than  her  master.  Eventually  even  this
last  shadow  of  subjection  disappears.  Absolutely  her  own
mistress,  the  woman  may  now  hold  property,  increase  her
fortune,  make  her  will,  lose  her  virtue  ;  but  her  dowry,
guaranteed  and  kept  intact  by  law,  remains  hers  to  the
end  of  her  life.

Nevertheless,  as  regards  succession,  the  woman's  rights
are  not  yet  the  same  as  the  man's.  It  is  true,  that  should
her  father  die  intestate,  she  takes  an  equal  share  with  her
brothers  of  the  inheritance  ;  but  in  all  other  cases  of
intestacy  the  nearest  female  agnate  stands  after  the  most
distant  male.  The  woman  cannot  now  do  any  legal  act
for  others,  though  this  had  not  been  forbidden  previously  ;
she  cannot  be  a  witness  ;  she  cannot  stand  security  for
the  debts  of  others.  The  Senatus-consultum  Velleianum
lays  it  down  as  a  fixed  rule,  which,  to  a  certain  extent,
has  remained  in  force  to  our  own  days — that  the  woman
must  not  undertake  any  obligation  on  behalf  of  others.
She  may  alienate  her  possessions  in  others'  favour,  may
incur  a  direct  obligation,  contract  a  debt,  and  transfer  the
money  to  others  ;  but  she  cannot  bind  herself  to  pay
another's  debt,  nor  guarantee  its  payment.  In  the  legis-
lator's opinion,  the  infirmity  of  her  sex  leaves  her  enough
intelligence  to  escape  danger  in  assuming  direct  obligations,
or  by  alienating  her  property,  but  not  enough  to  guard
her  from  lightly  undertaking  remote  and  indirect  lia-
bilities which  are  often  no  less  serious.

But  the  progressive  changes  in  the  Roman  family  are
not  yet  at  an  end.     To  the  numberless  causes  for  change


INCREASING  PREPONDERANCE  OF  THE  STATE.  377

already  in  existence  another  is  added,  when  Christianity
finds  its  way  into  the  Empire,  into  literature  and  law,
and  subverts  all  things.  According  to  the  law  of  Christ,
man  and  woman  are  equal  ;  father  and  mother  have  equal
rights  and  duties  in  respect  of  their  children,  for  whose
advantage  all  things  must  be  ordered  ;  whereas,  by  the
old  law,  the  rights  of  the  children  were  subordinated  to
the  interests  of  the  family.  A  new  element  is  now  intro-
duced into  Roman  law  which  further  changes  its  character,
already  much  modified  by  Greek  philosophy  and  by  Byzan-
tine despotism.  The  Canon  law  accepts  the  principles  of
the  Roman,  recognises  the  wife's  absolute  interest  in  her
marriage  portion,  and  rejects  the  pretensions  of  the  hus-
band. Woman  remains  excluded  from  every  office  which
the  ancients  deemed  proper  to  man  ;  she  cannot  enter  into
obligations  for  others,  nor  arbitrate,  nor  lay  an  accusation,
nor  bear  witness  in  court ;  her  evidence  has  no  legal
effect.  On  the  other  hand,  Roman  law  tends  inexorably
to  democratic  equality,  natural  equity,  and  to  the  absolute
predominance  of  the  State.  The  public  authority  deprives
domestic  authority  of  its  last  remnant  of  power  ;  it  may
almost  be  said  that  the  family,  as  a  body-politic,  disappears,
to  be  reconstituted  on  the  footing  of  reciprocal  affection.
The  final  seal  to  these  alterations  was  imposed  by  the
famous  law  of  succession  (Nov.  118  and  127)  enacted  by
Justinian  in  the  years  543  and  547,  which,  suppressing
every  privilege  of  sex  and  agnation,  fixes  rights  according
to  the  degree  of  relationship,  and  makes  them  reciprocal.
It  moreover  enlarges  the  amount  of  the  legitim,  and
ordains  that  the  dowry  of  the  wife  should  be  met  by
a  donatio  propter  nuptias  of  equal  value  from  the  husband,
and  that,  in  the  interest  of  the  children,  both  should  be
inalienable.  Even  with  the  consent  of  his  wife,  the
husband  cannot  sell  the  dowry  ;  he  may  only  administer
it,  and  there  must  be  complete  reciprocity.     The  wife  is


378    FAMILY  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES.

not  only  the  owner  of  the  dowry,  she  has  besides  a  general
charge  over  her  husband's  property  for  its  restitution,  with
a  right  of  action  to  enforce  it  as  against  all  his  other
creditors.  In  inheriting  from  their  children  the  mother
has  equal  right  with  the  father,  and  she  is  now  qualified  to
be  their  guardian.  Even  the  Senatus-consultum  Velleianum,
which  forbade  women  to  incur  obligations  on  behalf  of
others,  is  modified  with  the  same  scope.  Justinian,  indeed,
from  his  desire  to  protect  the  property  of  the  woman  against
all  danger,  is  strenuously  opposed  to  her  incurring  obliga-
tions on  behalf  of  her  husband  ;  but  he  is  much  more
indulgent  in  respect  to  obligations  undertaken  on  behalf
of  a  stranger.  These,  if  incurred  for  manifestly  good
cause,  are  valid  if  renewed  after  two  years.  Thus
modified,  the  Senatus-consultum  Velleianum  is  treated  with
respect  throughout  the  Middle  Ages.  Reciprocal  equality
is  now  achieved,  but  the  ancient  unity  of  the  family  is
dissolved  ;  the  compact  and  iron  nucleus  of  Roman  society
is  broken  to  fragments  by  the  continual  and  increasing
action  of  the  State.  In  all  her  institutions,  Rome  has
succeeded  in  arriving  at  democracy  and  equality,  but  at
the  cost  of  com.plete  individual  liberty,  and  by  sacrificing
the  development  of  special  associations  and  of  local  life
to  the  unity  of  the  State.  How  to  conciliate  these  two
elements  without  destroying  the  one  in  the  interest  of
the  other  will  be  the  problem  of  a  new  era  and  a  new
civilisation.   '

However  highly  we  may  rate  the  amazing  and  indisput-
able greatness  of  the  labours  of  Imperial  legislators  and
juris-consults  collected  in  the  Corpus  iuris  in  the  time  of
Justinian,  it  is  nevertheless  certain  that  the  ancient  and
primitive  character  of  Roman  law  has  been  profoundly
changed  by  it,  and  that  the  despotism  of  the  State,  always
prevalent  in  Rome,  has  been  enormously  increased.  It  is
for  this  reason  that  Tocqueville,  and  others  with  him,  go


ROMAN  LA  W  IN  MEDIJE  VAL  TIMES.  379

so  far  as  to  maintain  that  the  great  diffusion  of  the
Justinian  law  among  the  Latin  races  has  more  than  once
proved  hurtful  to  political  freedom.  To  many,  such  an
assertion  may  seem  absurd  ;  but  granting  that  there  is  a
close  bond  of  connection  between  private  and  public  law,
and  that  the  final  changes  in  Roman  law  were  introduced
by  the  action  of  the  growing  despotism  of  the  State,  the
opinion  advanced  by  the  French  writer  is  not  without  its
value.

V.

However  that  may  be,  it  is  undeniable  that  the  family,
as  we  now  find  it  constituted,  or,  more  correctly  speaking,
weakened,  by  the  Justinian  law  has  not  the  qualities  which
would  enable  it,  in  the  ages  of  barbarism  now  at  hand,
to  withstand  the  violent  onset  of  the  advancing  Germanic
peoples,  much  less  to  be  the  nucleus  and  germ  from  which
the  new  society  of  the  Italian  Commune  may  take  birth.
In  fact,  in  the  statutes  we  find  the  family  constituted  on
a  very  different  footing.  Agnation  has  recovered  its
ascendancy.  The  woman  is  under  a  new  species  ot
guardianship  ;  and  although  the  dotal  system  is  rigorously
observed,  there  are  innumerable  regulations  designed  to  keep
family  property  together,  or  make  it  revert  to  the  family,
so  as  to  preserve  the  domestic  patrimony  intact.  Here
an  important  question  arises,  namely,  whether  this  new
constitution  of  the  family,  which  stands  in  close  relation
with  the  public  law  of  the  communes,  is  a  return  to  the
|i  pre-Justinian  law,  or  derived  from  Germanic  institutions
5'  and  the  Longobard  law,  in  which  we  find,  in  fact,  pre-
cedence accorded  to  agnate  kin  and  a  more  stable  family
organisation }  Italian  writers,  the  earlier  writers  more
especially,  adhered  for  the  most  part  to  the  former  theory,
while  the  majority  of  German  authors,  who  have  recently


38o    FAMILY  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES.

found  disciples  even  among  ourselves,  adopt  the  second
riew.  Thus,  on  either  side  we  find  theories  propounded
9.S  to  the  constitution  of  the  Italian  family  in  the  Middle
A-ges,  analogous  to  those  concerning  the  origin  of  the
communes.  1

The  persistence  of  Roman  law  in  the  Middle  Ages,
even  when  the  condition  of  the  Italians  was  most  wretched,
and  when  all  things  seemed  to  be  subject  to  the  law  of  the
Longobard,  was  maintained  with  marvellous  learning  and
acumen  in  the  immortal  work  of  Savigny.  But,  in  truth,
though  public  law  and  penal  law  might  readily  be  altered
under  the  rule  of  the  conqueror,  there  was  little  likelihood
that  the  civil  law  which,  for  so  many  centuries,  had  filtered
into  the  usages  and  into  the  very  blood  of  the  Romans,
which  had  regulated  the  manifold  relations  of  a  civilised
people  and  satisfied  its  countless  requirements,  should
perish  utterly  beneath  the  sword  of  barbarians  unconscious
of  those  requirements  and  not  always  able  to  comprehend
those  relations.     Matters  of  which  they  were  to  a  great

»  Comitis  Gabriellis  Verri,  "  De  ortu  et  p'rogressu  iuris  mediolanensis,"
&c.  In  Book  I.  of  this  work  we  find,  among  others,  the  following  words  :
"  Quae  omnia  manifeste  demonstrant,  maiores  nostros  maximum  atque
perpetuum  studium,  contulisse  ad  agnationem  conservandam  pro  veteri
xii.  tabularum  iure,  a  Justiniano  postea  immutato,  quo  certe  nihil  ad
servandum  augendumque  familiarum  splendorem  .  .  .  utilius,  com-
modius,  aptius,  commendabilius  potuit  afferri."

Another  of  those  old  writers  on  law  who  steadfastly  maintain  this  view
is  Cardinal  De  Luca,  who,  in  his  "  Theatrum  veritatis  et  iustitice,"  makes
a  singularly  angry  attack  upon  Justinian  and  all  agreeing  with  his  views
on  the  subject  of  agnation.  According  to  De  Luca,  the  Italians  never
accepted  the  reforms,  or,  rather,  as  he  calls  them,  the  destructions  and
corruptions,  favoured  by  Justinian.

Even  Giannone,  in  his  "  Storia  Civile  del  Regno  di  Napoli "  (bk.  iii,
paragraph  v.),  says  that  Justinian's  works  met  with  no  favour  among  us.
"  They  found  no  acceptance  either  in  Italy  or  in  our  provinces,  nor  could
they  be  planted  and  strike  deep  roots  here,  as  on  foreign  soil ;  on  the  con-
trary, the  ancient  books  of  the  juris-consults  were  retained,  and  the  code
of  Theodosius  lost  neither  its  reputation  nor  its  authority."

Here  it  may  be  well  to  remark  that  the  persistence  of  the  Roman  law
in  Italy  during  the  Middle  Ages,  maintained  by  Savigny,  but  combated
by  others,  is  now  admitted  on  all  hands.


VESTIGES  OF  PRE-JUSTINIAN  LA  W.  381

extent  ignorant,    or    as  to  which    they  were   indifferent,
must  often  have  been  passed  over  without  notice  in  the
laws   framed   by    the   barbarians,    or   have  evaded    their
action.     Various  provisions,  therefore,  of  the  Roman  law —
those,  for  instance,  relating  to  marriage,  to  succession,  and
to  contract — must  often  have  continued  to  be  applied  by
the  Italians  in  conformity  with  ancient  usage.     This  will
be  more  readily  understood  if  we  reflect  that  while  the
Roman  law  had  become  the  law  of  all  in  those  countries
in  which  the  Roman  conquest  had  taken  deep  root,  the  laws
of  the  barbarians,  on  the  contrary,  according  to  Teutonic
usage,  always  presented  a  personal  character — that  is  to
say,  extended  only  to  the  people  with  whom  they  originated,
and  were  not    easily  communicated  to   others.     In    fact,
when,  as  a  consequence  of  successive  invasions,  different
Germanic  tribes,  whether    independent  of  each  other  or
in  subjection  one  to  another,  came  together  in  the  same
country,  each  of  them  continued  to  be  governed  by  its
own  peculiar  laws.     The  Romans,  on  the  contrary,  regard-
ing their  law  as  universal  in  character,  communicated  it  to,
and  imposed  it  upon  all.     It  was  almost  the  first  germ  of
the  greatness  and  the  civilisation  of  Rome,  and  for  that
reason  its   diffusion    was  considered    the    most  sacred  of
duties  by  this  sovereign  people.     Thus  it  was  that,  even
under  the  harshest  barbaric   oppression,  the  Roman  law
continued  to  be    the  private    law  of  the    Italians  in   all
those  cases,  and  they  were  not  few,  in  which  the  German
laws  failed  to  notice  it,  and  neither  abrogated  it  directly
nor  substituted  another  in  its  place.

But  the  presence  of  two  diverse  legislations,  the  one
imposed  by  force,  the  other  preserved  by  custom,
the  radical  change  of  conditions  occasioned  by  the
destruction  of  the  old  Roman  State  and  the  forma-
tion of  a  new  society,  could  not  fail  to  originate  a
new   life,   a   new   history   for    the  Italian    law.     In   the


382    FAMILY  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES.

statute  books  of  our  communes  we  find  Roman  and
Longobard  law  confronted  and  almost  contending,  each
modified  in  turn  by  the  action  of  the  other.  But  under
which  of  the  many  forms  through  which  it  has  passed  is
the  Roman  law  found  among  us  at  the  moment  when  it
seemed  on  the  point  of  being  overcome  by  the  Germanic
law  ?  Was  it  in  the  literary  and  philosophic  form  given
to  it  by  Justinian,  or  was  it  in  the  ^r^-Justinian  form,
which,  while  less  systematic,  was  also  less  altered  by
Byzantine  ideas,  and  more  in  accordance  with  usage  ?
Savigny  roundly  asserts  that  the  Pandects  on  their  com-
pletion were  at  once  sent  into  Italy,  and  that  immediately
after  the  power  of  the  Goths  had  been  shattered  by  the
Greeks  Justinian  hastened  to  issue  the  Constitution  (534),
whereby  legal  effect  was  given  to  them  in  the  land.
In  consequence  of  this,  he  continues,  the  Pandects  were
then  to  be  met  with  in  every  corner  of  Italy,  where  they
were  at  once  received  with  favour,  inasmuch  as  the
Justinian  law  was  specially  adapted  to  the  requirements  of
the  land.  This,  he  goes  on  to  say,  likewise  explains
why  it  was  that  all  the  earliest  Italian  commentators  or
glossators  devoted  themselves  exclusively  to  the  study  of
the  Corpus  iuris.  The  reader,  however,  may  easily
discover  that,  on  this  head,  Savigny  has  pushed  his  in-
ferences too  far.  More  than  once,  indeed,  he  is  com-
pelled to  put  a  false  interpretation  on  documents  that  they
may  not  contradict  his  theories  ;  and  more  than  once  the
documents  themselves  seem  to  warn  him  that,  even  in  the
Middle  Ages,  vestiges  of  a  ^r<?-Justinian  law  are  to  be
traced  ;  but  he  persists  still  more  resolutely  in  considering
all  this  to  be  only  a  survival  of  antiquated  forms.  Many  new
documents  have  recently  been  published,  and  the  question
again  presents  itself,  always  with  the  same  urgency.

As  a  German  writer,  well  versed  in  the   subject,  has
recently   observed,  everything   tends   to   show   that   the

PRE-JUSTINIAN  AND  LONGOBARD  FORMS.     3S3

history  of  Roman  law  In  the  Middle  Ages  should  be
divided  into  two  entirely  distinct  periods.  ^  During  the
first  it  endured  by  force  of  custom,  and  accordingly  many
pre- Justinian  formulas  survived  with  it ;  in  the  second
and  much  later  period  the  Justinian  law  prevailed,  pro-
moted still  further  by  the  literary  study  of  the  Pandects
undertaken  by  the  Bolognese  professors ;  it  was  only  then
that  the  most  ancient  formulas  wholly  disappeared.  This
view  is  supported  by  documentary  evidence  and  harmonises
with  the  character  of  the  times  and  with  the  requirements
of  society,  and  is  confirmed  by  our  old  writers  and  our
literary  traditions.

In  fact,  Savigny  himself  examines  and  recognises  the
full  importance  of  the  various  sources  of  /)r(?-Justinian
law  diffused  in  the  Middle  Ages.  The  code  of  Theodosius
(438)  which  then  possessed  great  authority,  and  the  edict
drawn  up  by  order  of  Theodoric  the  Ostrogoth  (500),
were  direct  compilations  of  the  old  Roman  Jurisprudence.

If  in  these  compilations  we  turn  our  attention  to  the
constitution  of  the  family,  more  particularly  as  regards
succession,  we  find  it  exactly  as  it  was  before  the  law  was
interwoven  with  the  Imperial  edicts. 2  The  Breviary  of
Alaric  ("  Lex  Romana  Visigothorum  ")  and  the  so-called
Papian  code  ("  Lex  Romana  Burgundioram "),  both,
posterior  to  the  year  500,  are  likewise  compilations  of
^r(?-Justinian  law,  and  are  found  to  be  diffused  in  several
provinces  of  the  Empire.  The  often-mentioned  "  Lex
Romana  Utiniensis,  seu  Curiensis,"  which  seems  to  be
ninth  century  rimpaslo  of  Alaric's  Breviary  for  the  use  of
Italians  in  lands  previously  under    Longobard  rule,  also

'  Dr.  J.  Ficker,  "  Forschungen  zur  Reichs  und  Rechtgeschicte
Italiens,'    4  vols.     Innsbruck,  1868-74.

"  Gans,  while  accepting  the  ideas  of  Savigny  as  to  the  diffusion  of  the
Justinian  law  in  Italy,  also  takes  this  view,  which  is  in  accordance  with
his  own  theory  that  the  new  forms  of  the  Italian  law  were  derived  from
the  laws  of  the  Longobards.


384    FAMILY  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES.

shows  the  same  characteristics.  It  is  true  that,  according
to  the  hypothesis  of  Savigny,  the  Breviary  of  Alaric  must
have  been  in  use  among  the  Franks  and  brought  by  them
to  Italy  after  the  expulsion  of  the  Longobards.  In  this
case  we  should  find  the  old  law  to  have  been  in  force
among  us  only  before  and  after  the  period  of  the  Longo-
bards ;  while  during  their  oppressive  rule  we  should
discover  no  certain  trace  of  it.  But  it  is  very  difficult  to
suppose  that  the  ancient  law,  based  as  it  was  upon
custom,  should  have  died  out  precisely  when  custom
might  have  preserved  it,  or  that  Roman  law  should  at
that  time  have  assumed  the  literary  Justinian  form  and
afterwards  have  returned  to  a  form  more  primitive.  Had
the  legislation  of  Justinian  in  its  genuine  form  been  once
accepted,  it  must  have  continued  to  gain  ground  with
the  advance  of  civilisation  and  under  the  less  severe
rule  of  the  Franks,  whose  mode  of  life  approached  much
nearer  to  that  of  the  Latins.  The  fact  is,  that  throughout
the  Middle  Ages  we  meet  with  pre-Justinian  legal  forms,
more  or  less  modified,  even  among  the  laws  of  the  Longo-
bards. ^  As  to  the  remark  that  the  earliest  Italian  com-
mentators, the  glossators^  directed  their  studies  to  the
Pandects  and  the  whole  of  the  Corpus  iuris — this  only
shows  that  on  the  revival  of  the  communes  and  of  letters
they  turned,  as  was  natural,  to  the  most  authoritative  and
literary  source  of  jurisprudence.  From  that  time,  in  fact,
no  other  is  looked  for. 2

It  should  also  be  remembered  that,  when  the  Greeks

'  Baudi  de  Vesme,  in  his  notes  on  the  Longobard  laws,  repeatedly
remarks :  "  Theodosiani  juris  vestigia  hie  agnoscere  mini  vedetur."
Del  Giudice  has  recently  proved  that  certain  passages  are  taken  from
the  Justinian  law  and  others  from  the  Theodosian  code.

'  This  discussion  may  now  be  considered  superfluous,  it  being
generally  acknowledged  at  the  present  day,  that  even  subsequently  to
Justinian's  constitution,  the  Theodosian  code  continued  in  force.  In
this  way  the  Justinian  and  pre-Justinian  forms  had  a  contemporaneous
existence,  only  the  Pandects  were  longer  neglected.

came  into  Italy  to  combat  the  Goths,  they  found  the
ancient  Roman  customary  laws  in  force  and  sanctioned  by
the  edict  of  Theodoric  ;  that  the  Goths  were  definitely
vanquished  in  553  ;  that  in  568  the  Greek  domination
was  followed  by  that  of  the  Longobards  ;  that  the  latter
confined  their  rivals  to  Southern  Italy,  whence  they  were
afterwards  expelled  by  the  Normans.  There,  in  the  south,
the  corrupt  Byzantine  despotism  proved  no  less  fatal  than
the  oppression  of  the  barbarians,  and  was  perhaps  the
prime  cause  of  the  many  disasters  and  prolonged  neglect
into  which  those  provinces  afterwards  fell.  But  was  it
possible  for  a  dominion  so  brief  and  troubled  to  diffuse
the  law  of  Justinian  in  Italy  with  such  effect  as  not  only
to  make  it  universally  accepted,  but  also  so  thoroughly
incorporated  with  customary  law,  that  it  could  survive
even  when  its  binding  legal  effect  was  no  longer  recognised
by  the  barbarians }

Such  an  hypothesis  will  seem  even  less  tenable  as  regards
everything  relating  to  the  family  and  to  succession,  if  we
reflect  that  the  reforms  introduced  into  this  branch  of  the
law  by  Justinian  at  Constantinople  in  no  way  corresponded
to  the  conditions  in  which  Italy  then  stood.  Notwith-
standing the  diffusion  of  Greek  philosophy  among  us,  the
spirit  of  Byzantium  was  by  no  means  identical  with  that
of  Rome,  and  there  was  still  less  identity  in  their  social
conditions.  In  Constantinople  Oriental  despotism  cor-
rupted, nay,  suffocated  society  by  excess  of  luxury  and
over-refinement  of  culture  ;  the  State  assuming  everything
to  itself,  imparted  a  new  character  to  the  laws.  In  Italy,
on  the  other  hand,  society,  no  less  corrupt,  had  become
disintegrated,  and  was  already  falling  to  pieces  ;  the
ancient  unity  and  strength  of  the  State  were  continually
diminishing  and  losing  strength,  and  less  and  less  resist-
ance was  opposed  to  the  assaults  of  the  barbaiians.  At
Constantinople  the  State  was  omnipotent,  while  in  Italy

its   vigour   was   on   the   wane.      Among  us,  accordingly
women  and  all  who  were  weak  were  naturally  driven  to
seek  refuge  in  private  associations,  and  above  all  in  the
bosom  of  the  family.     And  if  the  natural  force  of  events
had  power  to  urge  in  any  direction,  and  determine  any  new
tendency,  it  certainly  could  not  have  aimed  at  enfeebling
the  family  bond  by  subjecting  it  to  the  authority  of  a
tottering  State,  but  must  rather  have  sought  to  strengthen
it  as  the  only  possible  safeguard  amid  the  dangers  that
were  threatening  on  every  side.    This,  in  fact,  is  the  course
always  followed    in    barbaric    societies,  where,  the   State
being  powerless,  the  care  of  the  weak  and  the  punishment
of  injuries  are  entrusted  to  the  kinsmen.     In  short,  both
the  disordered  condition  of  Latin  society  and  the  example
of  the  barbarians   themselves   combined    to    offer   grave
obstacles  to  the  diffusion  of  Justinian's  laws,  more  especi-
ally when  the  old  Roman  customs  were  seen  to  be  better
suited   to   the   new   and  increasing  needs  of  society,  and
useful  for  the  reconstruction,  on  a  firmer  basis,  of  the  old
family  system,  now  become  more  essential  than  before  to
the  common  welfare.     No  other  way  was  left  for  begin-
ning  anew  the  social  task  and  advancing  afterwards  to
new   methods   and    institutions.       Nor   need    we    attach
much   importance  to  the  constitution   of  the  year   534,
knowing   how   wide  is  the   difference   between   the  pro-
mulgation  of  a  law   (especially  when   it   is  passed   by  a
short-lived  and   feeble  Government  in   a  society  that  is
lapsing  into   disorder)    and    its    actual    enforcement    and
incorporation    with    custom.       Even    under    the    Roman
Republic,  or  under  the  Empire,  old  laws  did  not  at  once
disappear  when    new   ones   were    proclaimed.       Even    in
modern   societies   we   may  note  how  tenaciously  ancient
customs  continue  to  be  observed  when  they  are  more  in
harmony   with    the    character    and    requirements   of  the
people.


CHANGE  OF  SOCIAL  CONDITIONS.  387

The  principles  of  the  Napoleonic  code  were  proclaimed
in  our  Southern  provinces  during  the  French  domination
and  afterwards  confirmed  by  subsequent  legislation  ;  and
according  to  that  code,  every  patrimony  was  bound  to
be  divided  equally  among  the  children.  Nevertheless,
in  the  two  Calabrias  and  many  other  Southern  provinces,
property  is  still  kept  undivided  in  the  family,  since,  by
common  consent,  only  one  of  the  sons  marries,  the  others
remaining  single.  For  the  same  reason,  the  smallest
possible  sum  is  assigned  to  the  daughters  ;  nor  do  all  of
them  marry,  some  being  persuaded  or  forced  to  take  the
veil.  Social  progress  alone  will  slowly  give  real  effect  to
the  principles   of  equality  sanctioned   by  the   codes.

Everything  therefore  points  to  the  conclusion  that
Roman  law  survived  among  us  to  the  downfall  of  the
Western  Empire,  preserving  by  usage  many  of  the  forms
that  had  belonged  to  it  before  the  compilation  of  the
Corpus  iuris.  While  in  this  state  it  came  into  contact
with  the  Germanic  code,  and  thereupon  began  the  series  of
mutual  alterations,  from  which  the  Italian  family  emerged,
reconstituted  in  a  totally  new  way,  and  together  with  it
the  Commune.  It  was  a  slow  transformation,  during  which
Latin  ideas  and  traditions  steadily  gained  ground,  and
gradually  fused  or  destroyed  the  barbarian  laws  and  insti-
tutions. When  communal  liberties  were  finally  pro-
claimed, a.  new  culture  was  inaugurated,  and  with  it  a
new  epoch  in  the  history  of  Roman  law.  The  university
of  Bologna  became  the  centre  for  the  diffusion  and  study
of  the  Pandects,  and  the  Corpus  iuris  became  speedily
regarded  as  the  primary  and  perennial  source  of  common
law  in  our  country.  The  tradition,  according  to  which
the  Pandects  of  Amalfi,  carried  off  by  the  Pisans,  were
by  them  discovered  and  made  known  for  the  first  time  to
the  Western  world,  dates  this  event  about  the  year  1135,
that  is  to  say  in  the  same  age  that  witnessed  the  rise  of


388    FAMIL  Y  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES.

the  communes,  and  in  which,  as  related  by  another  tradi-
tion, Guarnerius  founded  the  Bolognese  school  at  the
request  of  Countess  Matilda.^  Thus  our  conclusions  are
supported  alike  by  history,  legend,  and  logic.


VI.

In  Italy,  therefore,  at  the  beginning  of  the  Middle
Ages,  the  family  accorded  a  preference  to  the  agnates,
and,  in  consequence  of  the  continuous  weakening  of  the
State,  was  obliged  to  seek  in  itself  for  increased  strength.
The  inroads  of  the  barbarians  brought  with  them  a
different  constitution  of  the  family,  but  this  could  effect
no  great  change  in  our  own  family  system  until  the
Longobards  had  firmly  established  their  dominion  over
us.  There  then  began  a  great  change  in  the  social  con-
dition of  Italy,  which  was  forcibly  compelled  to  assume  a
form  more  or  less  barbaric.  Hence  it  concerns  us  to  study
the  Longobard  family  system,  that  we  may  see  how  far
and  in  what  way  it  could  thus  alter  ours.

Like  every  other  barbaric  society,  that  of  the  Longo-
bards was  founded  upon  force;  in  time  of  war  it  was
compactly  united  under  a  king ;  during  peace  it  split  into
groups,  from  want  of  vigour  in  the  central  authority,
and  from  the  excessive  independence  of  subordinate  chiefs.
Hardly  had  barbarian  kingdoms  begun  to  be  erected  in
the  West  with  a  certain  degree  of  stability,  than  we  find
them  subdividing  into  marquisates,  dukedoms,  separate
groups,  and  at  a  later  period  into  feudal  holdings.  If
we  look  to  the  primitive  conditions  of  these  barbarians
before  they  come  among  us,  we  find  them  scattered  over

•  According  to  Savigny,  the  school  of  Guarnerius  was  already
flourishing  in  ii  13-18.  It  is  now  well  ascertained  that  this  school
was  preceded  by  others  adhering  far  less  closely  to  Justinian  forms.

THE  ROMAN  AND  THE  GERMANIC  FAMIL  Y.     389

the  country,  without  any  city  properly  so-called,  and  with
no  true  conception  of  the  State,  which  for  them  seems  to
consist  in  a  confederation  of  secondary  groups.  The  social
unity  of  the  barbarians  is  to  be  found  in  the  villages  or
even  in  the  tribes,  which  are  societies  originally  derived
perhaps  from  a  single  family.  Everywhere  the  State  as-
sumes family  forms.  The  social  strength  of  the  Germans
is  more  manifest  in  the  lesser  groups,  and  consequently  in
the  family.  We  ought  not  to  be  surprised,  therefore,  at
finding  the  family  constituted  more  solidly  with  them  than
among  the  Latins,  who  now,  for  many  centuries,  had  been
altering  and  modifying  it  under  the  growing  pressure  of
State  control.

Originally  the  barbarian  family  had  been,  like  the
Roman,  an  association  consecrated  by  religion.  A  tutelary
goddess  presided  over  the  domestic  hearth  ;  the  father  was
priest  and  protector  of  the  family.  In  Rome  the  control
was  in  the  hand  of  a  single  person,  who  ruled  with  an
iron  authority,  but  in  Germany  this  authority  was  shared
by  all  male  members  of  the  family  fit  to  bear  arms.  At
Rome  the  family  was  an  absolute  monarchy,  its  senior
members  being  always  regarded  as  the  most  powerful;  but
in  Germany  it  more  resembled  a  Republic,  consisting  of
all  the  adult  male  members,  except  such  as  were  disqualified
by  bodily  infirmity.  The  family  council  aided  the  Roman
father  and  tempered  his  rigid  despotism  ;  whereas  in  Ger-
many the  council  predominated  and  assumed  to  itself  the
chief  share  of  the  family  power.  The  Roman  father
could  rupture  every  domestic  tie  at  his  will ;  he  could
remove  his  son  from  the  family,  sell  him,  or  put  him  to
death.  The  German  son,  on  the  contrary,  when  able  to
bear  arms  and  fight  by  his  father's  side,  might,  if  he  chose,
separate  himself  from  his  original  family  and  join  another
tribe.  Among  the  Germans  bodily  strength,  property
held  in  common,  and  natural  ties  of  blood  constituted  the

family ;  in  Rome  it  was  the  conception  of  the  family  in
itself  that  dominated  over  everything  and  made  it  authori-
tative and  sacred.  In  Rome  the  individual  was  merged
in  the  State,  the  son  in  the  father;  whereas,  among  the
Germanic  tribes,  individual  liberty  was  much  greater,  and
if  to  us  the  State  has  the  appearance  of  a  confederation,
the  family  seems  a  society  of  more  independent  members
united  by  mutual  agreement.  Punishments,  transgressions,
property,  all  were  in  common;  if  any  member  of  the
family  suffered  wrong,  it  was  the  kinsmen's  part  to  avenge
him  and  obtain  retribution.  For  sales  and  donations,  as
well  as  for  acts  of  revenge,  the  consent  of  every  member
was  required,  inasmuch  as  the  property  belonged  to  the
whole  family,  and  ought  to  stay  with  it:  whence  the
inutility  of  testamentary  dispositions,  which  were  in  fact
unknown  to  the  barbarians.  Property  was  sacred ;  it
constituted  the  family,  conferred  social  rights  and  obliga-
tions, and  rested  chiefly  in  the  hands  of  the  males.  In
this  family,  and  in  this  society  founded  wholly  on  force,
the  woman,  being  incapable  of  bearing  arms,  was  com-
mitted, like  all  other  weaklings,  to  the  defence  and
protection  of  her  armed  kinsmen,  and  so  came  under  their
perpetual  guardianship  (mundium,  munt^  manus).  This
tutelage  being  established  on  account  of  the  weakness  and
infirmity  of  the  sex,  could  never  come  to  an  end,  as  it
might  in  Rome,  where  it  had  been  constituted  wholly  in
the  interest  of  the  family.  But  the  Germanic  woman,
although  oppressed,  liable  to  be  deprived  of  her  property,
to  be  sold,  or  made  a  slave,  was  under  a  power  which,
being  divided  among  many,  was  feebler  and  less  despotic
than  the  Roman  domestic  rule.  She  was  a  dependent
member  of  the  family,  but  the  authority  of  her  father,
brothers,  or  sons  was  shared  by  all  her  other  kinsmen.
Hence  it  was  easy  for  the  woman  to  find  a  protector.
Her   incapacity    by    reason    of    her    infirmity    did    not


TEUTONIC  MARRIAGE  CUSTOMS.  391

entail  incapacity  in  the  eye  of  the  law.  She  could
appear  in  court,  choose  some  one  to  represent  her  there  ;
she  could  own  property;  she  could  inherit,  although
taking  a  less  share  than  would  have  come  to  her  had
she  been  a  man.  The  man  listened  to  her  advice,  and
treated  her  with  religious  respect;  but  it  was  the  respect
due  to  her  weaker  sex,  not  as  in  Rome,  where  respect  was
offered  to  the  mother,  to  the  wife,  to  the  sacred  character
which  was  the  foundation  at  once  of  the  Roman  family
and  of  Roman  greatness.

Longobard  law,  essentially  Germanic,  prevailed  long  in
Italy,  where  plain  traces  of  its  survival  are  to  be  recog-
nised as  late  as  the  fourteenth  century.  Under  the
stronger  influence  of  the  Roman  jurisprudence  it  very
soon  lost  its  native  rudeness  and  originality.  As  to  this
change,  Gans,  in  his  "History  of  the  Law  of  Succession,"
has  observed:  "The  fact  that  after  the  historical  redaction
of  this  law,  another  and  systematic  compilation  of  it  was
made,  should  prove  to  us  how  it  was  that  the  more
confused,  but  at  the  same  time  more  natural,  spontaneous,
and  vigorous  character  of  the  Germanic  law  must  neces-
sarily have  been  altered,  and  as  it  were  crystallised  into  a
form  that  rather  belongs  to  the  Roman."  It  was  precisely
this  form  that  so  greatly  promoted  its  diiFusion  among  us.


VII.

With  the  Longobards,  as  with  all  the  Germanic  nations,
woman  was  never  released  from  tutelage  {mundium\  never
became  her  own  mistress  {^selbmundia).  The  man  who
desired  to  make  her  his  wife  must  first  of  all  pay  the
price  of  the  mundium  or  guardianship  which  the  marriage
would  give  him  over  her ;  next  he  must  bind  himself  to
make  good  the  meta^  a  species  of  dowry  noticed  by  Tacitus


392    PAMILY  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES,

when  he  remarks  that,  among  the  Germans,  the  husband
brought  the  dower  to  the  wife,  instead  of  the  wife  bringing
it  to  the  husband.  To  the  meta^  also  known  afterwards
under  the  name  of  doialitium,  dos,,  sponsalicium^  &c.,  there
was  added  the  faderjium,  which  the  father  might,  if  he
chose,  give  to  his  daughter.  On  the  morning  of  the  day-
after  the  wedding  the  husband  presented  his  bride  with  a
gift  {morgengah\  attended,  according  to  a  very  question-
able interpretation,  as  the  price  of  her  virginity.  When
Longobard  customs  came  to  be  affected  by  the  growing
influence  of  the  Roman  law,  the  amount  of  the  meta  and
of  the  morgengab  was  restricted.  In  the  age  of  the  com-
munes, th.Q.  faderjiumy  now  transformed  into  a  dower,  was
also  limited  by  law.  The  meta,  faderfi urn,  and  morgengab
belonged  to  the  wife,  who  could  require  them  to  be  given
up  to  her  on  her  husband's  death.  But  by  a  peculiarity
of  the  Germanic  law,  retained  in  its  entirety  even  by  the
Longobards,  the  Roman  regulation,  which  made  the  dower
the  separate  and  independent  property  of  the  wife  [even
during  her  husband's  lifetime],  was  never  accepted.  The
only  property  owned  absolutely  and  exclusively  by  the
woman  was  what  was  given  her  by  the  husband.  The
Germanic  law  favoured  the  principle  of  common  owner-
ship. As  to  this,  Gans  observes  : — "  It  is  not  necessary
with  us,  as  with  the  Romans,  that  a  woman  should  have
separate  property  of  her  own  in  order  to  assert  her  juridical
personality,  and  prove  her  equality  with  her  husband.
She  possesses  what  her  husband  possesses,  and  her  equality
rests  on  the  mutual  affection  which  makes  all  differences
disappear."  In  the  ordeal  by  combat  the  husband  repre-
sented the  wife,  since  she  was  under  the  protection  of  his
sword  ;  if  she  were  taken  in  adultery  he  might  put  her
to  death.  All  her  possessions,  movable  or  immovable,
including  even  nuptial  gifts  made  to  her  by  friends,  became
the  property  of  her  husband,  who  had  only  to  provide


FAMIL  Y  LA  W,  LONGOBARD  AND  ROMAN.     393

against  the  contingency  of  the  marriage  being  dissolved
by  death  :  whence  the  necessity  of  the  meta  and  the
donatium.

If  the  wife  died  without  issue,  everything  went  to  the
husband  ;  on  the  husband's  death,  the  wife  was  entitled
to  receive  the  meta  and  morgengah  (donation).  For  any-
thing more  she  was  entirely  dependent  on  the  generosity
of  her  husband,  who,  at  a  later  period,  was  permitted  to
leave  her  the  half,  and,  eventually,  the  whole  usufruct  of
his  possessions.

While  the  marriage  laws  of  the  Longobards  and  the
Romans  differed  thus  widely,  their  laws  relating  to
guardianship  were  also  different.  The  mundium  of  the
Longobards,  as  we  have  seen,  is  not  to  be  confounded
with  the  tutela  to  which  the  Roman  woman  was  sub-
jected. Originating  in  the  incapacity  to  bear  arms,  it  was
of  limited  duration  in  the  case  of  males,  and  ceased  with
their  incapacity.  At  first  the  limit  was  fixed  at  the  age
of  twelve,  at  a  later  period  of  eighteen  years.  But  for
the  woman,  who  could  never  become  capable  of  bearing
arms,  it  was  perpetual.  From  the  mundium  of  her  father,
she  passed,  on  marriage,  under  that  of  her  husband  ;  and
on  the  death  of  her  father,  if  then  a  widow,  under  the
mundium  of  her  own  son,  or  of  the  agnates,  who  were  also
her  heirs.

In  default  of  other  guardians  she  was  protected  by  the
Curtis  Regia.  But  in  every  case,  whether  under  father,
husband,  son,  agnates,  or  Curtis  Regta^  the  mundium  was
identical  in  character,  having  for  its  object  the  protection
of  the  weak.  This  could  not  be  said  of  the  Roman  tutela,
which  had  its  origin  in  the  Roman  conception  of  the
family.  The  tutela  of  the  Roman  father  over  his  children
lasted  all  his  life  ;  but  he  could  divest  himself  of  it.  The
mundium  of  the  Longobard  father  lasted  while  his  children
were  incapable  of  bearing  arms,  and,  as  a  logical  conse-


394    FAMILY  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES.

quencc,  ceased  when  the  incapacity  terminated.  While
it  cannot  be  positively  asserted  that  emancipation  was
unknown  to  the  Longobards,  it  may  be  believed,  from  the
tendency  of  their  law,  to  have  been  of  rare  occurrence.
When  the  Roman  woman  was  subjected  to  the  potestas
of  her  father,  the  manus  of  her  husband,  the  tutela  of  the
agnates,  there  were  three  kinds  of  guardianship  very
different  from  each  other,  corresponding  with  the  difference
in  the  domestic  relations  of  those  who  exercised  the
right.  No  one  of  them  had  anything  in  common  with
the  mundium.

The  Longobard  father  had  the  right  to  sell  his  sons  ;
he  represented  them  in  courts  of  law ;  whatever  they
acquired  was  his.  But,  as  we  have  already  shown,  his
authority  was  tempered  by  the  family  council,  in  which
the  brothers  of  the  mother — the  children's  natural  pro-
tectress— had  much  to  say.

The  Longobard  family  law  has  marked  peculiarities  in
regard  to  succession  as  well  as  to  marriage.  And  first,  it
should  be  noted  that  the  disposal  of  property  by  will  was
recognised  by  the  Longobards.  This  seems  contrary  to
the  usage  of  the  Germanic  tribes,  among  whom  wills  were
unknown,  but  may  be  referred  to  the  modifying  action
of  the  Roman  on  the  Longobard  law.

The  fact,  however,  that  with  the  Longobards  donations
and  wills  were  irrevocable,  indicates  a  Germanic  character,
or  rather  the  trace  of  it,  for  the  main  feature  of  the  Roman
will  consisted  in  its  revocability.  Of  the  essential  prin-
ciples of  the  Roman  Testamenti  factio  the  Longobards
were  ignorant.  Legitimate  children  came  first  in  the
order  of  inheritance,  and  with  them  came  natural  children
also,  the  latter — though  not  in  strictness  forming  part  of
the  family — being  admitted  to  succeed  along  with  the
former,  though  taking  a  less  share.  They  might,  how-
ever, be  put  on  an  equal  footing  by  being  legitimated.


PREFERENCE  GIVEN  TO  AGNATES.  395

At  a  later  period  this  essentially  Germanic  peculiarity  of
the  laws  of  succession  was  done  away  with  by  the  action
of  the  Roman  and  Canon  laws,  which  exclude  natural
children.  Originally,  by  the  Longobard  law,  a  legitimate
child  took  two-thirds  of  the  inheritance,  leaving  one-third
only  to  the  natural  children.  If  there  were  two  legiti-
mate children,  the  natural  children  took  only  a  fifth  ;  if
three,  a  seventh.

It  was  forbidden  to  leave  more  than  the  prescribed
share  to  natural  children,  and  no  child  could  be  disin-
herited without  just  and  manifest  cause.  The  reasons  for
disinheriting  a  child  were  borrowed  from  the  Roman
code.  It  was  allowable,  however,  to  favour  one  son  more
than  the  rest.

The  preference  accorded  to  males  over  females  is  a
point  of  much  importance,  and  is  another  of  the  special
characteristics  of  the  Longobard  law.  When  the  testator
had  one  son  and  one  or  more  unmarried  daughters  he  was
obliged  to  leave  a  fourth  of  the  inheritance  to  the  latter,
but  when  there  were  several  sons  the  daughters  only
received  a  seventh  part.  Married  daughters  had  no  right
to  any  share  in  the  inheritance,  but  had  to  be  content
with  what  they  had  received  on  the  day  of  their  marriage,
and  could  claim  nothing  more.  Failing  male  issue,
daughters  were  next  heirs,  and  whether  married  or
single  inherited  as  though  they  were  males.  Another
peculiarity  of  Longobard  law  was  the  great  favour  shown
to  daughters  or  sisters  of  the  testator  domiciled  in  his
house — in  capillo.  A  brother  is  excluded  in  favour  of  a
daughter  or  niece — a  remarkable  instance  of  this  strange
and  singular  preference  accorded  to  females.  We  likewise
find  that  unmarried  daughters  and  sisters  inherit  on
equal  terms  when  living  under  the  parental  or  fraternal
roof.

We  have  already  noticed  that  the  statutes  of  the  Italian


390    FAMILY  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES.

communes  accord,  as  does  also  the  Longobard  law,  a
decided  preference  to  agnates  over  cognates^  and  that  this
circumstance  has  given  rise  to  keen  discussion.  Many
persons,  indeed,  insist  on  detecting  in  this  preference  an
absolutely  Germanic  characteristic  transfused  into  the
statutes  from  the  Longobard  law.  But  we  have  seen
that  through  the  greater  part  of  its  history  the  Roman
law  also  gave  a  preference  to  the  agnates,  and  that  it  was
only  at  a  very  late  period  that  it  lost  this  feature,  which
was  still  to  some  extent  retained  in  Italy  at  the  time  of  the
barbarian  invasions.  That  the  preference  of  the  agnates
was  not  borrowed  by  the  statutes  from  the  Longobard
law  will  be  even  more  conclusively  shown  if  we  consider
the  manifest  differences  which  prevail  on  this  very  point
between  the  Germanic  and  the  Italian  laws  ;  and  bear  in
mind  the  important  fact  that  the  preference  continued  to
increase  in  strength,  at  the  very  time  when  the  action  and
influence  of  the  Roman  law  are  increasingly  apparent  in
the  statutes.  In  truth,  the  more  closely  we  examine  the
matter,  the  more  we  are  compelled  to  recognise  that  it
was  political  reasons  altogether  peculiar  to  the  Italian
communes  and  to  Italian  society  in  the  Middle  Ages
that  led  to  this  preference  of  the  agnates.  But  even  here
the  reciprocal  action  of  the  one  law  upon  the  other  is
clearly  traceable,  for  we  can  perceive  that  the  succession
of  the  agnates,  under  the  Longobard  law,  has  itself  been
modified  by  the  Roman,  which  has  made  it  careless  of  the
nature  of  the  property  of  which  the  inheritance  consists  ;
whereas  it  is  the  peculiar  and  constant  characteristic  of
the  Germanic  law  that  such  succession  should  be  ruled
according  both  to  the  degree  of  kinship  and  the  nature
of  the  inheritance.

In  conclusion,  it  may  be  said  generally  that  with  the
Longobards  the  ties  of  blood  predominate  ;  that  in  their
family    there    is    greater    individual    freedom,    and    the


jl  GENESIS  OF  FEUDALISM.  397

family  itself  is  much  less  affected  by  the  action  of  the
State.  With  the  Romans,  on  the  contrary,  the  conception
of  the  family  is  stronger  than  the  ties  of  blood  ;  the  unity
of  the  family  depends  at  first  on  an  absolute  paternal
despotism,  afterwards  destroyed  by  the  authority  of  the
State,  which  to  a  great  extent  assumes  its  place.

From  this  time  the  State  is  predominant  in  all  things  ;
it  reduces  the  family  to  fragments,  and  aims  at  the  com-
plete equality  of  all  without  having  the  strength  to
consolidate  a  society  in  which  neither  individual  liberty,
local  activity,  nor  free  associations  were  allowed  sufficient
scope  for  their  development.  Yet  all  these  were  abso-
lutely necessary  for  the  preservation  of  a  huge  social
structure  made  up  of  distinct  races,  and  consequently
destitute  of  the  national  character  and  unity  which  the
Republic  and  the  Empire  had  imposed.  It  was  precisely
these  new  elements  that  were  introduced  among  us  by
the  barbarians.  And  thus  it  was  that  two  peoples,  two
forms  of  family  and  society,  I  might  almost  say  two  ideas,
two  wholly  different  types  of  society  were  brought
together,  of  which  the  one  had  become  the  necessary
complement  of  the  other.  From  their  forests  the  Germans
brought  individual  freedom,  personal  independence,  the
force  of  small  associations;  the  Latins  had  already  dis-
covered the  unity  of  the  State,  the  wider  and  more
organic  conception  of  society,  and  the  political  idea  of
the  family  which  we  shall  see  hereafter  triumphing  in  the
Commune.

From  the  fusion  of  these  two  different  societies  that
modern  society  is  to  arise  in  which  the  action  of  the
one  is  seldom  dissociated  from  that  of  the  other,  and  it
becomes  impossible  to  ascribe  the  result  exclusively  to
either.

VIII.

But  while  the  co-existing  and  contending  laws  of  the
Romans  and  Longobards  arc  the  two  juridical  elements
most  plainly  to  be  recognised  in  the  Italian  statutes,  there
are  others  also  claiming  remembrance,  and  among  these
the  feudal  and  the  Canon  law  must  be  noticed.  Feudalism
is  one  of  the  most  important  institutions  in  the  history  of
the  Middle  Ages  ;  it  is  the  first  form  that  society  assumes
on  emerging  from  the  chaos  of  barbarism,  and  it  is  stamped
with  a  character  essentially  Germanic.  With  it,  property
and  the  family  take  a  new  and  peculiar  shape.  We  may
pronounce  it  to  be  the  first  and  chief  political  and  social
manifestation  of  Germanic  individuaUsm.  The  barbarian
tribe  had  a  natural  tendency  to  split  into  small  groups,
into  families  solely  united  by  the  bond  of  common  danger.
During  invasions  the  tribe  transformed  itself  into  an
armed  band,  left  behind  all  weak  or  incapable  members,
accepted  recruits  even  from  neighbouring  tribes,  and  being
under  the  command  of  one  chief,  was  forced  by  the  exi-
gencies of  war  to  be  firmly  and  compactly  united.  The
attacks  previously  made  on  them  by  the  Romans  had,
for  like  reasons,  the  effect  of  creating  among  the  bar-
barians certain  strong  and  powerful  kingdoms  by  the
union  of  different  tribes  ;  but  these  never  lasted  long,
since  as  soon  as  peace  was  restored  they  began  anew  to
fall  apart  and  dissolve.  Scarcely  had  the  barbarians  begun
to  settle  themselves  in  the  West,  than  their  incapacity  to
establish  the  unity  of  a  State  was  made  clearly  manifest.
The  moment  peace  was  declared  the  leaders  of  the
various  armed  bands  proceeded  to  divide  the  conquered
territory.  They  then  separated,  and  their  king,  or
supreme  chief,  remained,  as  it  were,  isolated,  and  with
very  scant  authority.  Every  leader  tried  to  possess  him-
self of  some  stronghold  where  he  might  rule  as  an  abso-


LONGOBARD  AND  ROMAN  FEUDAL  LAW.     399

lute  lord,  barely  acknowledging  his  dependence  on  the
king.  In  the  fief  thus  created,  ownership  and  sovereignty
became  confused,  but  were  both  considered  to  be  held
i^'per  heneficium)  as  of  favour  from  a  more  powerful  lord,
subject  to  certain  burthens  and  obligations.  Originally  a
temporary  grant,  the  benefice  or  fief  only  became  heredi-
tary at  a  later  time.  At  first  it  could  be  resumed  by  the
donor  ;  it  reverted  to  him  on  the  death  of  the  feudatory,
that  it  might  be  transmitted  by  a  new  grant  to  the
feudatory's  heirs  ;  it  then  gradually,  by  use,  abuse,  or
special  act  of  concession,  became  an  hereditary  estate.
Eventually  all  property,  possession,  or  ownership  came
to  be  held,  during  the  Middle  Ages,  on  feudal  tenure.
The  want  of  vigour  in  the  supreme  political  power
obliged  the  weak  to  seek  protection  elsewhere.  Many
independent  landowners  voluntarily  accepted  the  position
of  vassals  ;  while,  on  the  other  hand,  the  obstacles  en-
countered by  the  great  lords  in  enforcing  their  authority
over  wide  territories  compelled  them  to  cede  part  of  their
land  in  benefice  to  lesser  vassals.  In  this  way  the  State,
the  Church,  all  things  assumed  a  feudal  form.  This
system  was  completely  established  in  the  eleventh  century,
when  the  communes  arose  in  Italy  to  combat  and  over-
throw it.

In  a  fortified  castle  it  was  natural  that  the  ties  of  the
family  should  become  continually  stronger  :  a  fortress
must  suffice  for  itself.  It  was,  as  it  were,  the  independent
world  of  the  lord  who  dwelt  in  it,  and  divided  his  time
between  perilous  adventures  and  domestic  life.  All  his-
torians have  noted  that  feudalism  produced  increased
respect,  affection,  and  chivalrous  regard  for  woman,  and
made  man  more  resolute  and  energetic.  Save  in  times  of
war,  the  baron  was  almost  absolute  and  independent  lord
of  his  small  realm,  wherein  all  were  his  subjects.  From
him  his  vassals  received  the  posts  of  seneschal,  count  of


400    FAMILY  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES,

the  palace,  equerry,  and  the  like,  which  offices,  being
granted  in  a  form  more  or  less  feudal  to  persons  of  noble
birth,  had  a  tendency  to  become  hereditary.  A  numerous
retinue  somewhat  relieved  the  loneliness  of  the  castle
The  sons  of  subordinate  nobles  frequented  the  court  of
their  liege  lord,  to  be  trained  to  polite  manners  and  the
arts  of  chivalry,  and  finally  to  receive  the  sword  from  his
hands  and  be  proclaimed  knights.  All  this  gave  prestige
to  the  castle,  and  secured  the  fidelity  of  the  vassals  to
their  lord,  while  at  the  same  time  it  flattered  the  pride  of
the  inferior  nobility.

The  Longobard  feudal  law  is  found  to  have  points  of
connection  with  the  laws  of  Rome  which,  though  very
different  in  spirit,  are  often  called  to  its  aid.  Often,
however,  they  are  found  to  be  in  opposition.  There  can
be  no  doubt  that  the  Roman  lav/  manifests  in  Italy  its
persistent  action  on  the  feudal  law.  The  fief,  as  is  well
known,  not  being  absolute  independent  property,  but  only
a  limited  and  conditional  grant,  cannot,  from  its  nature,  be
subject  to  the  hereditary  principle.  On  the  contrary,  the
right  of  the  heir  must  be  recognised  anew  in  his  person,
since,  as  we  have  seen,  he  does  not  derive  it  from  any
right  in  his  predecessor.  And  this  continued  to  be  the
practice  even  after  custom  had  begun  to  make  the  tenure
hereditary.  According  to  feudal  law,  the  successor  was
not  then  considered  to  represent  the  person  whose  heir  he
was ;  the  original  grant  was  renewed  in  his  behalf.  More-
over, when  a  fief  has  once  become  hereditary,  the  whole
family  has  a  right  to  it,  not  derived  from  the  will  of  the
last  holder  at  his  death,  but  already  existent  during  his
life.  It  is  therefore  necessary  to  establish  an  order  of
succession  to  determine  which  member  of  the  family  shall
be  preferred,  and  this  order  of  succession  begins  to  be
borrowed  from  the  Roman  code.  Although  differing
from  the  true  and  correct  order  of  succession,  it  is  gradually


[To  /ace  page  401.


ACTION  OF  CANON  LA  W.  401

confounded  with  it,  and  finally  alters  and  dissolves  the
fief.  Thus  the  Roman  law  penetrates  and  modifies  the
feudal.

From  the  very  nature  of  a  fief,  female  descendants
cannot  inherit,  and  the  male  descendants  of  deceased  sons
succeed  equally  with  surviving  sons.  Nevertheless  there
are  certain  fiefs  which,  having  been  originally  bestowed
upon  females,  must,  in  default  of  heirs  male,  naturally
pass  to  females ;  but  as  soon  as  the  male  line  is  established,
male  heirs  have  the  preference.  Ascendants  cannot
succeed,  because  succession  is  determined,  not  by  relation-
ship, but  by  the  original  grant;  accordingly  the  reversion
falls,  not  to  the  ascendant,  but  to  the  original  granter  of
the  fief.  Collaterals  of  the  last  holder,  unless  descendants
of  the  first,  are  not  entitled  to  succeed ;  nor  can  brothers,
as  such,  succeed,  unless  their  father  has  held  the  fief.  Nor
can  husband  and  wife  succeed  to  each  other.  But  under
the  growing  influence  of  common  law  all  these  primitive
characteristics  likewise  disappear.  Feudal  law  has  little
importance  in  the  Italian  statutes;  but  the  political  and
social  importance  of  feudalism  in  the  history  of  our  com-
munes is  immense.  It  represents  a  society  distinguished
by  laws  and  usages  of  its  own,  and  that  appeals  to  the
Emperor,  whose  judgments  and  judges  it  always  prefers
to  the  laws  and  magistrates  of  the  Republic  which  it
despises,  and  would  fain  ignore.  The  Republic  in  conse-
quence looks  on  the  nobility  as  a  foe  to  be  destroyed,  but
this  it  can  only  efi^ect  after  sanguinary  struggles  in  the
course  of  which  it  will  be  itself  profoundly  changed.

Canon  law  undoubtedly  plays  a  part  in  the  history  and
formation  of  the  communes  that  should  not  be  overlooked,
though  by  no  means  corresponding  with  the  greatness  of
the  political,  social,  and  religious  influence  of  the  Church.
Made  up  of  fragments  from  the  writings  of  the  Fathers,

with  a  large  admixture  of  Roman  law,  it  appeals  also  to
the  authority  of  reason  and  of  Holy  Writ.  It  thus
declared  itself  favourable  to  natural  equity,  as  opposed  to
legal  sophistry,  tempered  the  harshness  of  barbaric  laws,
protected  the  weak,  upheld  the  sanctity  of  the  family,  and
aided  the  triumph  of  the  Roman  law  over  that  of  the
Longobards.  But  it  also  sought  to  subordinate  the  civil
power  to  the  ecclesiastical;  it  added  to  the  number  of
exceptional  tribunals;  it  favoured  inquisitorial  jurisdiction,
torture,  and  trial  by  ordeal.  Moreover,  its  constant  ten-
dency to  encroach  on  the  field  of  civil  law  found  an  open
door  in  the  oath  which  every  magistrate,  the  Podesta
included,  had  to  take,  with  the  prescribed  formula:
**  saving  conscience "  {salva  la  coscienza)  expressed  or
understood.  As  it  rested  with  the  clergy  to  determine
cases  of  conscience,  so  also  it  was  for  them  to  decide  on
the  validity  of  oaths.  This  naturally  fostered  the  diffu-
sion of  canon  law.  The  exclusion  of  natural  children
from  succession  and  the  suppression  of  divorce  are  not  a
little  due  to  the  operation  of  this  law.  Its  action  is  to  be
seen  plainly  enough  in  the  statutes,  but  still  more  clearly
in  the  struggle  between  the  civil  authority  and  the  eccle-
siastical, wherein  the  latter  endeavours  to  maintain  its
inviolable  privileges,  its  exceptional  tribunals,  its  supremacy
even  in  causes  civil  and  political.


IX.

In  the  statutes  therefore,  we  find  four  different  legisla-
tions, contending,  as  it  were,  with  one  another :  the
Longobard,  the  Roman,  the  Feudal  and  the  Canon  law.
These,  however,  may  almost  be  reduced  to  two,  seeing
that  feudal  law  is  Germanic,  and  canon  law,  in  so  far  as  it
affects  the  statutes,  is  mainly  Roman.     So  that  here  again

we  are  met  by  the  old  hostility  between  Germans  and  Latins,
The  two  races  are  opposed,  as  also  their  institutions,
laws,  and  ideas ;  their  minds  seem  to  challenge  one
another  wherever  they  meet,  whether  in  the  field  of  letters,
politics,  or  art.  Yet  each  has  need  of  the  other,  and  both
must  disappear  to  make  way  for  a  new  social  system  and
a  more  comprehensive  spirit  which,  resulting  from  the
fusion  of  two  warring  elements,  will  remain  sole  victor  in
this  prolonged  contest.  In  Italy,  however,  the  Latin
strain  always  predominates,  as  we  see  even  in  the  statutes,
wherein  Roman  law  forms  the  keystone  of  the  whole
juridical  structure.

The  earliest  compilation  of  the  statutes  dates  from  the
very  time  when  a  knowledge  of  the  Corpus  iuris  begins  to
be  diffused  throughout  Italy  from  the  University  of
Bologna.  From  that  time  forth  the  legislation  of  Jus-
tinian was  regarded  as  an  epitome  of  juridical  philosophy,
as  the  law  par  exceLence^  and  is  recognised  by  all  our  Re-
publics as  the  common  law,  the  law  to  be  applied  whenever
the  statutes  are  silent.  For  this  reason  that  part  of  the
statutes  which  relates  to  the  civil  law  is  very  much  less
developed  than  the  political  part ;  and  for  this  reason
those  teachers  whose  studies  have  been  directed  chiefly  to
civil  jurisprudence  occupy  themselves  much  more  with
Roman,  canon,  feudal,  and  Longobard  law  than  with  the
law  of  the  statutes.  These  they  examined,  especially  at
first,  rather  as  a  result  of  the  study  of  the  Roman  law,
than  as  deserving  careful  attention  on  their  own  account ;
they  regarded  them  as  the  written  expression  of  popular
custom  to  which  no  great  scientific  value  could  be  attached,
as  something  outside  the  one  legal  system  which  alone
merited  universal  admiration.

A  long  period  elapsed  before  writers  on  law  began  to  apply
their  minds  to  the  consideration  of  the  statutes,  the  great
importance  of  which  has  been  only  completely  recognised


404    FA  All LY  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES.

in  our  day.  Venice  is  perhaps  the  only  Commune  in
which  it  was  customary,  in  the  absence  of  statutory  pro-
visions, to  appeal  to  natural  reason  :  whence  Bartolo's
remark  that  the  Venetian  magistrate  gave  judgment  manu
regia  et  arhitrio  suo.^  But  even  in  Venice  such  decisions
must  always  have  been  inspired  or  guided  by  a  knowledge
and  admiration  of  the  Roman  law.

What  has  been  said  will  put  in  a  clear  light  the  extra-
ordinary importance  accorded  to  the  University  and  the
professors  of  Bologna  in  connection  with  their  labours  in
annotating  and  interpreting  the  Corpus  iuris  so  as  to
make  it  intelligible  to  all,  and  an  instrument  for  instruct-
ing and  training  all  those  who  sought  to  follow  the  legal
profession,  whether  as  notaries,  judges,  Podestas,  or  cap-
tains of  the  people.  That  these  teachers  possessed  a  very
slender  knowledge  of  history  is  seen  from  their  writings.
Their  merit  lay  in  the  intelligent  exposition  of  a  system
of  law  which  had  never  become  extinct.  It  was  a  precept
of  theirs  that  "  as  the  unskilled  rider  must  hold  on  by
the  pommel,  so  the  judge  should  stick  to  the  gloss."  In
this  way  the  school  of  Bologna  became,  as  it  were,  the
depository  of  an  universal  law  which  was  looked  upon  as
almost  sacred.  Thither  popes  sent  their  decretals,
emperors  their  edicts  for  registry  or  revision.  The
Emperor  was,  however,  regarded  as  the  living  source  of
legislation,  as   alone   entitled   to   add  new  laws   to   the

Roman.  Any  one  speaking  evil  of  the  Emperor  met
with  condign  punishment.  Any  one  who  questioned  his
universal  authority  was  declared  heretical  by  the  jurists
themselves.  This  authority  belonged  to  him  as  lord  of
all  nations,  and  was  transmitted  to  him  from  the  Roman
Empire  as  its  rightful  heir.  It  was  natural,  therefore,  that
to  determine  the  extent  and  limits  of  this  authority,
recourse  should  again  be  had  to  the  professors  of  Bologna,
the  veritable  depositaries  of  the  Roman  law,  who  accord-
ingly acquired  a  constantly  increasing  impoitance.  The
ratio  scripta  was  what  was  always  called  for  ;  and  the
communes,  even  while  avowing  their  determination  to
preserve  their  ancient  liberties  undiminished,  never  forgot
to  profess  their  willingness  to  leave  the  Emperor  all  the
veteres  justitias  which  belonged  to  him,  and  which  they
declared  themselves  desirous  to  respect.  The  only  ques-
tion was  to  ascertain  what  these  were,  and  hence  fresh
occasion  to  consult  the  professors  of  Bologna.

Before  the  great  contest  between  the  Lombards  and
Frederic  Barbarossa,  a  genuine  judicial  trial  was  held,
ending  with  the  condemnation  of  the  Milanese,  who  were
declared  rebels,  adstipulantibus  judicibus  et  primis  de
Italia.  At  Roncaglia,  Frederic  exercised  judicial  and
legislative  authority,  with  the  assistance  of  four  professors
from  Bologna,  who  maintained  the  Emperor's  rights,  not
from  any  hostility  to  their  own  country,  but  because,  as
professors  of  Roman  law,  they  were  the  natural  champions
of  the  Holy  Roman  Empire.  Nor  did  the  communes
themselves  raise  any  objection  to  these  claims.  After
Frederic's  defeat  they  continued  to  draw  up  their  statutes,
laws,  and  public  instruments  in  his  name.  Even  as  late
as  the  fifteenth  century,  we  find  that  notaries  still  gave
validity  to  public  documents  by  making  them  run  in  the
name  of  the  Empire.  At  the  peace  of  Constance  the
power  to  appoint  magistrates,  civil  and  criminal,  consuls,

Podesta,  and  notaries,  was  expressly  reserved  to  the
Emperor,  whose  prerogative  in  such  matters,  as  well  as  of
deciding  causes  of  serious  importance  on  final  appeal,  was
fully  recognised.  If,  in  fact,  the  Milanese  paid  little
regard  to  the  Emperor's  authority,  his  right  was  not
questioned.  The  Lombards  acknowledged  themselves  his
lawful  subjects,  though  they  afterwards  chose  to  act  as
if  free  and  independent.

When  Henry  VII.  came  to  Italy,  in  Dante's  time,  he
too,  brought  the  Italian  cities  to  trial,  pronounced  sentence
on  them,  exacted  fines  on  men  and  money,  and  cited
King  Robert  of  Naples  to  appear  before  him.  At  that
time  many  must  have  deemed  these  proceedings  farcical ;
but  they  were  echoes  of  a  bygone  age,  of  a  past  which
even  Alighieri's  immortal  genius  thought  to  recall  to  life,
as  his  letters  and  his  book,  *' De  Monarchia,"  serve  to
show.  The  Church,  it  is  true,  constantly  withstood  the
Empire,  but  during  the  whole  of  the  Middle  Ages  the
Emperor's  political  and  juridical  authority  was  never  called
in  question,  was  invariably  recognised.

While  the  continual  struggle  between  Church  and
Empire,  communes  and  feudal  lords,  Guelphs  and  Ghibel-
lines,  was  being  waged,  the  statutes  were  framed.  In
these  were  recorded,  not  only  new  customs  written  down
as  they  were  formed,  but  also  all  the  old  customs  that  had
been  modified  by  the  new.  Although  the  j  urists  of  Bologna
thought  it  no  concern  of  theirs  to  study  a  system  of  law,
which  being  in  common  use  was  then  well  known,  and
which  had  its  source  in  that  Roman  jurisprudence  which
engaged  their  attention  through  their  whole  lives,  for  us
it  is  certainly  a  study  of  grave  importance,  as  a  means
of  accurately  estimating  cne  value  and  character  of  this
communal  life  in  the  Middle  Ages.  We  may  have  very
long  to  wait  before  we  can  completely  solve  the  problem.
Nevertheless  we  may  make  a  beginning  by  examining  the


MUTABILITY  OF  THE  ITALIAN  COMMUNE.    407

various  statutes,  comparing  them  with  one  another,  and
also  comparing  the  different  forms  which  each  of  them
received  at  different  stages  of  drafting,  in  order  to  discern
the  evolution  of  the  new  law,  to  ascertain  and  understand
the  principle  which  governs  it.


X.

The  whole  life  of  the  Commune  is  embraced  in  the
statutes :  the  election  and  functions  of  political  magis-
trates; public,  civil,  criminal,  administrative,  and  com-
mercial law.  Public  law  is  the  subject  most  fully  dealt
with  ;  while,  for  reasons  already  explained,  civil  law  is  left
very  incomplete.  Nevertheless  the  statutes  handle,  with
more  or  less  detail,  such  matters  as  personal  status^
dowers,  contracts,  judicial  procedure,  succession,  wills,
rights  arising  in  respect  of  contiguous  lands  or  houses,
and,  above  all,  the  family.  They  aim  at  a  simple  and
summary  procedure,  free  from  chicanery,  whereby  causes
may  be  settled  fairly  and  promptly  ;  but  from  defective
drafting,  from  admitting  a  running  commentary,  altogether
out  of  place  in  legal  enactments,  and  from  leaving  too
much  to  the  discretion  of  the  judge,  they  generally  lead
to  a  contrary  result.  It  is  indeed  astonishing  to  observe
how,  during  those  centuries  in  which  a  splendid  literature
was  growing  up,  when  the  most  unpretentious  writings
offer  us  an  example  of  good  style,  and  when  judges,
notaries,  and  professors  of  law  had  the  imperishable
model  of  the  Corpus  iuris  constantly  before  their  eyes,
the  statutes  should  have  been  written  in  a  form  so  illi-
terate that  we  may  often  pronounce  it  barbarous,  and
always  involved  and  confused.  The  statutes  constitute  a
legislation  based  upon  custom,  mutable,  popular,  still
uncertain  of  itself,  which,  taking  its  birth  in  the  midst  of


4o8    FAMILY  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES.

civil  wars,  always  retained  their  likeness,  and  never  arrived
at  classical  elegances,  which  in  any  case  would  have  been
made  impossible  by  the  scholastic  jargon  that  still  prevailed
in  our  Universities  and  among  our  jurists.  Petrarch's
animadversions,  directed  chiefly  against  the  obscure
phraseology  of  the  professors  of  law  in  his  time,  were  fully
justified.  The  classical  revival  which  sought  to  introduce
a  purer  and  more  elegant  latinity  had  to  make  a  beginning
outside,  and  often  in  opposition  to  the  Universities.  It
spread  far  and  wide  during  the  fifteenth  century,  but
always  retained  a  literary  and  philosophical  rather  than  a
juridical  character.

Notwithstanding  the  greatness  of  its  merits  and  aims,  the
Italian  Commune  has  in  it  something  of  the  transitory  and
mediaeval  ;  it  constantly  indicates  a  period  of  change.  It
is  the  germ  from  which,  at  a  later  time,  modern  society  is
to  issue,  but  the  birth  cannot  be  accomplished  until  the
germ  itself  is  destroyed  ;  consequently  it  always  remained
in  a  state  of  incessant  transformation.  Sprung  from  the
conjunction  of  two  different  societies,  the  Roman  and
Germanic,  it  derived  from  the  former  the  general  idea  of
the  State,  from  the  latter  individual  liberty,  local  activity,
and  the  force  of  special  associations.  The  problem  it  had
to  solve,  and  that  constitutes  its  essential  life  and  history,
lies  precisely  in  its  ceaseless  efforts  to  harmonise  those  two
elements  which  long  remained  not  only  separate  but  often
opposed.  Until  complete  fusion  was  effected  by  the
destruction  of  the  Commune  itself,  the  contest  continued
to  be  waged,  and  was  accompanied  by  inevitable  disorder.
In  the  Commune,  government  and  public  policy  have  an
importance  unknown  to  barbaric  society,  but  the  Com-
mune still  wears  the  character  of  a  powerful  assemblao-e  of
small  associations  rather  than  of  a  single  society,  or  of  a
State  in  the  true  and  strict  sense  of  the  word.  Life  indeed
courses  more    swiftly  through  these    numberless  groups,


JEALOUSY  THE  DOMINANT  FEATURE.         409

and  is  quickened  by  their  activity.  Social  vigour  is  chiefly
to  be  looked  for  in  family  cliques,  and  in  the  Companies
of  the  Arts  and  Trades,  of  the  Nobles  and  of  the  Burghers,
all  of  whom  have  laws,  statutes,  magistrates,  and  tribunals
of  their  own.  Hence  arises  an  extraordinary  interlacing
of  ordinances,  of  conflicting  passions,  of  diverging  or
clashing  interests.  True  individual  liberty,  true  equality
before  the  law  is  not  yet  understood  ;  but  the  individual
is  trained  and  protected  by  the  association  to  which  he
belongs,  which  lends  him  a  certain  degree  of  strength,  and
secures  him  an  increasing  share  of  freedom.  These  sub-
sidiary groups,  however,  unlike  those  which  we  have
already  met  with  in  the  Germanic  societies,  cannot  be
separated,  but  must  live  together  in  the  State,  outside  of
which  there  is  no  reason  for  their  existence.  The  infinite
multiplication  of  these  groups,  their  jealousies  and  con-
tinual jarrings  and  collisions,  made  the  Republic  all  the
more  indispensable  to  them,  all  the  more  the  object  of
their  hopes  and  love.  Every  one  of  these  merchant-
citizens  was  ready  to  give  his  life  for  this  Republic,  on
which,  both  in  peace  and  in  war,  his  own  welfare  and  that
of  the  various  associations  depended.  The  heads  and
leading  members  of  these  associations  were  privileged  to
sit  in  the  Councils  of  the  State,  governed  it  as  masters,
and  found  it  their  only  sure  defence  against  the  countless
rivals  with  whom  each  of  them  had  to  contend.  Indi-
vidual and  general  interests  thus  worked  in  concert,  and
the  fragmentary  power  divided  among  so  many  hands,
was  nevertheless  able  to  guard  the  liberty  of  all,  at  a  time
when  no  true  conception  of  the  State  or  of  general
equality  had  yet  arisen.  Still,  it  is  easy  to  imagine  how
ill-arranged  and  inconclusive  must  have  been  the  legisla-
tion of  republics  thus  divided  and  subdivided,  in  which
at  every  step  some  new  special  statute  or  tribunal  was
encountered.     And    this   at    a    time    when    judicial   and


4IO    FAMILY  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES,

political  power  were  so  strangely  intermixed,  that  whoever
had  a  share  in  the  one  necessarily  shared  in  the  other.

The  dominant  feature  in  all  the  civil  enactments  of  the
statutes  seems  to  be  a  jealousy  of  neighbouring  communes,
and  a  fear  lest,  as  a  result  of  marriage,  property  should  be
withdrawn  from  the  city,  the  society,  or  the  family.  To
guard  against  this,  both  law  and  custom  provided  so  effi-
caciously, that  even  in  a  Republic  as  democratic  as  that
of  Florence,  wherein  every  vestige  of  aristocracy  was
destroyed,  and  the  Ciompi  obtained  the  upper  hand,  we
find  landed  property  so  strictly  tied  up  that  there  are
families  who,  to  this  day,  own  the  same  estates  which  were
held  by  their  ancestors  in  the  fourteenth  century.  The
necessity  for  keeping  families,  associations,  and  party-
circles  intimately  united,  and  making  each  member  of
them  bound  for  the  rest,  is  so  strikingly  apparent,  that  it
is  these  political  and  social  considerations  which  determine
the  tendency  of  the  civil  law,  and  often  impede  its  natural
development.  So  that  even  here,  notwithstanding  the
weakness  of  the  State,  we  again  recognise  the  old  Latin
tradition,  which  always  accords  an  excessive  importance  to
political  considerations,  and  consequently  a  preponderating
influence  to  public  over  private  law.  The  Italian  statutes,
therefore,  can  only  be  explained  and  understood  in  con-
nection with  the  history  of  the  communes,  which  they
illustrate  in  their  turn.  And  this  is  another  reason  why
the  professors  of  Bologna,  accustomed  to  the  philosophical
character  of  Justinian's  legislation,  and  unfamiliar  with
the  methods  of  historical  exposition,  so  long  neglected  the
statutes.

Also,  as  might  be  expected,  the  predominating  action
of  political  considerations  is  most  clearly  shown  in  the
constitution  of  the  family.  Here  the  rights  which  flow
from  the  Commune's  conception  of  the  family  prevail
over   the   ties  of  blood  which  by  the  Germanic  law  are


CHAR  A  CTERISTICS  OF  STA  TUTOR  Y  LAW.     411

much  more  respected.  The  regulations  of  the  Roman
law  as  to  dower  are  fully  accepted,  but  the  dower  itself  is
restricted  to  a  small  amount.  Males  have  a  marked  pre-
cedence over  females,  and  over  descendants  in  the  female
line.  But  in  all  circumstances  the  woman  is  entitled  to
alimony.  It  is  not  meant  that  she  should  be  rich,  or
should  divide  the  domestic  patrimony,  and  transfer  it  to
another  family,  much  less  to  another  Commune  ;  but  in
any  event  she  must  be  assured  of  a  suitable  maintenance,
according  to  her  rank  of  life.  She  remains  under  the
perpetual  protection  of  the  mondualdo  (legal  guardian),
but  the  mundium  assumes  in  the  statutes  the  character  of
the  later  Roman  tutela,  with  which  it  almost  seems  to  be
confounded.  The  woman  may  call  upon  the  judge  to
assign  her  a  mondualdo,  and  may  choose  him  herself  when
she  requires  him  for  any  special  business.  Everywhere,
indeed,  we  see  this  tendency  to  transform  Longobard
institutions  into  Roman,  so  that  often  nothing  is  left  to
the  former  save  the  name.

Immovable  property  was  so  strictly  settled  that  a  very
small  part  of  it  could  be  disposed  of  by  the  father  at  his
death.  No  one,  therefore,  born  of  a  family  in  easy  cir-
cumstances was  exposed  to  any  anxiety  as  to  his  future.
It  is  to  be  noted,  however,  that  in  our  communes,  all  of
which  resembled  great  commercial  houses,  the  proportion
of  immovable  to  movable  property  was  extremely  small ;
and  that  if,  as  regards  the  former,  there  was  much
security  and  stability,  for  the  latter  there  were  rapid  gains,
unforeseen  fortunes,  and  sudden  fluctuations  of  capital

The  father's  authority  was  held  in  veneration,  and  the
utmost  confidence  reposed  in  guardians  of  his  choice  ;
but  we  do  not  find  in  the  statutes  any  great  development
of  the  patria  fotestas.  On  the  contrary,  as  in  other  cities,
the  marked  characteristic  of  the  family  is  their  doing
everything  in  common.     All  affairs  of  moment  are  settled


412    FAMILY  AND  STATE  JN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES.

by  the  family  council,  by  an  assembly  of  relations.  Both
law  and  custom  continue  to  follow  this  course.  In  the
family,  the  party-circle,  or  clique,  and  the  association,  the
community  of  interests  is  sometimes  carried  to  extra-
ordinary lengths.  Not  only  may  a  father  or  brother  be
summoned  to  pay  the  debts  of  a  son  or  brother,  but
every  creditor  of  a  consociation  can  sue  its  individual
members,  and  one  associate  may  be  made  liable  even  for
the  crimes  of  another.  Within  the  circle  of  the  family  or
association,  disputes  were  settled  by  arbiters,  whose  awards
had  the  validity  of  legal  sentences.  The  trade  associa-
tions, as  we  have  already  stated,  had  regularly  con-
stituted, special  tribunals  of  their  own.  These  incidents
and  characteristics  of  statutory  law  certainly  cannot  be
referred  to  the  Roman  legislation,  but  find  their  explana-
tion in  the  very  beginnings  of  Italian  history  to  which
Germanic  races  and  institutions  undoubtedly  contributed
in  no  small  degree.  The  distinctive  character  of  the
Commune  remains  always  the  same.  On  the  one  hand
particular  associations  attain  great  development ;  on  the
other  the  action  of  the  political  power  is  sometimes  too
feeble,  but  at  times  exercises  a  pressure  such  as  would
seem  excessive  even  at  this  day.  In  a  society  in  which
the  State  is  so  feeble  that  its  very  existence  seems  con-
tinually threatened,  it  is  certainly  strange  to  find  it  inter-
fering so  directly  and  extensively  in  the  private  affairs  of
the  citizens.  The  emancipation  of  sons  is  to  be  effected
with  due  solemnity  at  a  full  meeting  of  the  Council  of
the  People,  in  the  presence  of  the  heads  of  the  Republic.
Should  a  noble  citizen  desire  to  change  his  abode  and
move  to  another  quarter  of  the  city,  the  matter  must  be
brought  before  the  same  Councils  of  the  People  and  the
Commune,  and  decided  by  a  special  Act.^     We  find  the

chief  magistrates  of  the  Florentine  commonwealth  con-
tinually altering  the  boundaries  and  extent  of  the  Quartieri
or  Sestieri  of  the  city,  enlarging  or  contracting  now  one
and  now  another  in  order  to  preserve  the  balance  which  is
always  being  threatened  by  parties  and  sects,  and  prevent
any  one  quarter  from  winning  undue  predominance.  A
change  of  abode  from  one  district  of  the  town  to  another
might  drag  a  citizen  into  a  different  sect  or  party,  and  so
become  of  political  importance.  All  this  shows  more  and
more  clearly  that  society  had  not  yet  found  its  natural
and  permanent  basis.  The  manifold  new  and  varied
elements  entering  into  its  composition  were  being  de-
veloped on  all  sides  ;  but  the  synthetic  power  which
unites  and  assimilates  could  never  be  attained  by  the
Italian  Commune.

XL

Coming  now  to  a  particular  examination  of  the  statutory
provisions  which  most  nearly  concern  the  subject  in  hand,
we  shall  direct  our  attention  more  especially  to  the  Floren-
tine statutes  which,  for  us,  have  a  twofold  importance.
We  have  undertaken  this  study  as  an  aid  to  the  clearer
comprehension  of  certain  political  reforms  in  Florence,
which  are  only  to  be  explained  by  the  social  conditions
of  the  Republic.  In  this  study  of  the  Florentine  Com-
mune it  is  necessary  to  bear  in  mind  that  in  no  other
'  Commune  was  aristocracy  so  radically  destroyed  and
democracy  so  thoroughly  triumphant.  Every  trace  of
feudalism,  every  foreign  element  disappears  from  its
statute  book,  which  consequently,  in  spite  of  perennial
alterations,  preserves  a  uniform  and  consistent  character,
and  tends  always  towards  the  scope  that  it  finally
attains.  Other  statute  books,  on  the  contrary,  are  no
less   copiously   altered;    but  the   alterations   are   due  to


414    FAMILY  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES.

less  permanent  causes,  to  elements  most  extraneous  to
the  life  of  the  Commune,  and  which  therefore  make  it
still  more  difficult  to  understand  what  are  the  true
principles  moulding  the  laws  and  determining  their
historical  character.

If  we  begin  by  examining  the  paternal  authority  as  set
forth  in  the  statutes,  we  at  once  perceive  the  uncertainty
that  prevails  in  this  legislation.  At  first  we  find  the
Longobard  mundium,  but  this  gradually  takes  the  shape
of  the  Roman  patria  potestas^  as  regulated  by  Justinian's
legislation,  which  finally  prevails,  although  never  abso-
lutely. In  the  various  provisions  of  the  statutes,  which,
even  on  this  point,  are  always  defective,  we  sometimes
find  the  son  placed  under  a  stricter  subjection  than  by
Roman  law,  while  at  other  times,  the  Longobard  law
predominating,  he  enjoys  the  greatest  independence.
Generally  there  are  special  political  or  commercial  reasons
at  the  root  of  this  illogical  inconsistency.  By  the  Roman
statutes  the  son  is  entitled  to  appear  in  criminal  cases,
without  permission  from  his  father,  who  is  not  held
liable  for  crimes  committed  by  his  son.  The  son,  how-
ever, may  be  punished  by  his  parents  at  their  discretion.
The  natural  children  of  magnates  are  in  an  inferior
position,  both  civilly  and  politically,  to  sons  born  in  wed-
lock, inasmuch  as  they  are  never  eligible  to  any  public
office. I  According  to  the  Pesaro  statutes,  a  son  may
dispose  by  will  of  all  his  earnings,  provided  he  leaves
the  obligatory  usufruct  to  his  father ;  but  sons  marry-
ing without  their  father's  consent  may  be  disinherited. ^
When  a  son  is  condemned  to  pay  a  fine,  the  father  must
give  him  his  share  of  the  inheritance  wherewith  to  pay  it.
Should  a  father  beat  his  sons  or  grandsons  or  their  wives,

in  nihilo  puniatur,  nisi  pro  enormi  delicto.^  In  Lucca,
a  son  who  is  eighteen  years  of  age,  may  contract  a  loan,
even  without  his  father's  leave.  But  a  father  may  send
his  son,  whether  emancipated  or  under  tutelage,  to
prison  if  he  has  dissipated  his  private  means  or  led  an
evil  life.  The  magistrates  must  execute  the  father's
decision  without  calling  for  proofs. 2  A  son  may  thus
be  arbitrarily  confined  to  the  house,  fettered  and  im-
prisoned by  his  father,  who  is  only  bound  to  supply  him
with  the  necessaries  of  life.  The  same  rule  obtains  with
regard  to  other  descendants.  If  in  all  this  great  variety
of  laws  we  try  to  discover  any  one  characteristic  peculiar
to  the  statutes,  we  must  seek  it  in  the  unitas  persona
between  father  and  son,  which  is  often  carried  to  a  great
length.  This,  too,  is  a  result  of  the  general  conception
of  the  family  recognised  by  the  statutes.  In  Urbino  and
elsewhere  the  father  may  be  punished  for  the  son,  the
master  for  the  servant. 3  As  to  the  liabilities  of  com-
merce, these  are  shared,  not  only  by  father  and  son,  but
by  the  whole  body  of  the  relations,  as  we  find  was  the
case  in  Genoa,  Florence^  and  many  of  the  principal
trading  cities.  In  Florence,  the  father,  grandfather,  and
great-grandfather  incur  the  same  liability  for  a  descendant
(even  if  under  guardianship)  who  engages  in  trade,  as
though  they  stood  surety  for  him.  To  escape  this
responsibility  they  must  make  a  public  and  formal  dis-
claimer of  liability,4  Thus,  if  an  unemancipated  son  is
agent  or  factor  of  a  company  or  house  of  business,  the
father  is  responsible  for   him,  unless  he   has   given    the

parties  legal  notice  to  the  contrary.  For  the  same  reason
the  emancipation  of  the  son  must  be  publicly  performed
and  communicated  to  the  Society  of  Merchants.  *  When
a  daughter  marries,  she  ceases  to  be  subject  to  the
paternal  authority,  and  can  no  longer  be  held  in  any
way  responsible  for  her  father,  either  as  regards  civil
obligations  or  criminal,  should  the  father  have  evaded
punishment  by  flight.

In  Florence,  the  woman  is  under  the  perpetual  protec-
tion of  the  Mondualdo.  The  term  was  still  retained  in
the  eighteenth  century,  but  under  the  statutes  the  mundio
soon  becomes  almost  identical  with  the  Roman  tutelage  ;
as  time  goes  on  it  gradually  falls  into  disuse,  but  the
rights  of  women  are  never  made  equal  with  those  of  men.
In  respect  of  marriage  the  intermixture  of  different  legal
systems  is  most  marked.  Professor  Gans  has  noted  how
the  Pisans,  finding  that  the  Roman  law  forbade  a  woman
to  re-marry  within  a  year  from  her  husband's  death,  that
the  Canon  law  (interpreting  the  apostle's  words  as  an
unqualified  permission)  contained  no  such  prohibition,
and  that  the  Longobard  law  forbade  re-marriage  only  for
thirty  days,  fixed  by  their  statutes  the  prohibited  period
at  six  months.  But  this  rough  compromise  neither  met
the  object  intended  by  the  Roman  law,  namely,  that  a
second  marriage  should  not  take  place  during  the  preg-
nancy which  might  possibly  result  from  the  first,  nor
conceded  the  liberty  allowed  by  the  Canon  law  and  the
Longobard.  More  commonly,  however,  the  union  of
different  laws  is  brought  about  by  the  gradual  trans-
formation of  one  into  another.  The  Pisan  statutes,  for
instance,  regulate  marriage  almost  entirely  according  to
the  Roman  Code.  To  the  dower  {^dos)  brought  by  the
wife,  and  the  donation  {donatio  propter  nuptias,  called
also  antef actum)  given    by  the  husband,  they  join  other

»  "Statuta  Florentiae"  (edition  dated  from  Friburg),  ii.  no.

gifts,  to  which  they  give  the  name  ^^  cor  redo, ^'  which,
on  the  dissolution  of  the  marriage,  belong  to  the  wife  :
should  they  then  be  found  to  have  been  consumed  or
made  away  with,  she  would  be  entitled  to  two-thirds  of
their  value.  As  a  rule  Pisan  husbands  and  wives  hold
their  property  entirely  separate,  so  that  marriage  seems
sometimes  to  involve  a  hostile  relation,  rather  than  a
community  of  interests. '

Certain  statutes  admit  the  dos  and  donatio  ■proper
nuptias  together  with  the  meta  and  the  Longobard
donation.  The  Florentine  statute  speaks  of  a  dowry,
of  a  donation  that  must  be  equal  to  one  half  of  the
dowry — provided  this  does  not  exceed  the  sum  of  fifty
lire — and  of  an  augmentation.  Failing  sons,  grandsons,
or  grandsons  of  sons,  the  wife,  at  her  husband's  death,
recovered  possession  of  her  dowry,  with  the  donation  and
augmentation  ;  otherwise  she  had  her  dowry  alone,  and
whatever  her  husband  might  leave  her  by  will.  If  the
husband  died  before  receiving  the  dowry,  the  wife  took
the  promised  donation,  limited  however  to  one-eighth  of
her  husband's  estate,  over  which,  to  the  extent  of  her
dower,  she  had  a  preferential  mortgage.  Nor  had  the
wife's  consent  to  the  sale  or  alienation  of  her  husband's
property  the  effect  of  releasing  her  right  to  the  subjects  so
sold  or  alienated.  This  regulation,  however,  only  comes
into  force  from  the  year  1388.2  This  date,  which  is  given
in  the  printed  Florentine  statute  of  141 5,  shows  that  the
dotal  system  and  the  separation  of  property  had  by  this
time  made  great  progress,  a  fact  farther  confirmed  by  the
statutes.

The  wife  could  not  maintain  her  right  to  her  husband's
property  {defendere  bona  virt)  against  her  husband's
creditors  at  large,  but  only  against  those  who  were  liable

for  the  restitution  of  the  dower.  Dotal  property,  of
which  no  valuation  had  been  made,  might  be  claimed  by
her  as  against  any  creditor,  and  if  her  husband  fell  into
difficulties,  she  could  always  demand  restitution  of  her
dower.  I  Property  acquired  or  inherited  by  the  wife
during  the  husband's  life,  belonged  to  her  ;  but  she  could
not  alienate  it  without  the  consent  of  the  husband,  who
was  also  entitled  to  the  usufruct.  On  the  decease  of  the
husband,  whatever  remained  of  the  usufruct  might  be
claimed  by  the  wife,  or,  if  she  too  were  dead,  by  the
children.

XII.

The  dotal  system  and  separation  of  conjugal  property
are  not  only  recognised  in  all  the  statutes,  2  but  are  often
enacted  in  an  exaggerated  form,  as  seems  to  be  the  case  in
the  statutes  of  Pisa.  Thus  gifts  between  husband  and  wife
are  forbidden,  sometimes  even  gifts  from  them  to  strangers,
where  there  is  ground  to  suspect  that  these  are  meant  to
disguise  a  gift  between  the  spouses.  Zealous  precautions
to  hinder  property  being  withdrawn  from  the  family,  still
more  from  the  city,  are  universal.  In  Urbino,  for  instance,
no  alien  could  inherit  ab  intestato^  without  first  pledging
his  word  to  reside  within  the  city  or  territory.  3  At  Pesaro
a  similar  pledge  was  exacted  from  any  alien  who  sought  a
bride  in  that  city  ;  he  had  also  to  obtain  the  consent  of
the  Podesta.

In  Verona,  4  women  might,  under  a  will,  share  equally
with  their  brothers  ;  but  ab  intestato^  they  had  only  their

dower.  In  Pisa,  testate  succession  was  regulated  in
accordance  with  the  Roman  law  :  de  ultimis  voluntatibus
peu  legem  romanum  iudicetur.  The  lawful  share,  however,
was  fixed  on  almost  the  same  scale  as  by  Longobard  law  ;
and,  as  provided  by  that  law,  one  child  might  be  favoured
more  than  the  rest.  As  regards  intestate  succession,
male  heirs  had,  as  always,  marked  preference.  Failing
descendants  in  the  male  line,  females  inherited,  but  even
in  the  succession  to  maternal  estate,  male  descendants  had
priority  when  there  were  no  surviving  daughters,  i  This
rule  prevails  in  all  statute  books,  not  excluding  the
"  Consuetudini  "  of  Naples,  of  Amalfi,  and  of  Sorrento,
although  in  these  cities  the  influence  of  the  Longobard
law  was  much  less  felt.  2  The  real  object  of  these  regula-
tions is  clearly  expressed  in  the  statutes  themselves.  In
the  statutes  of  Mantua  it  is  thus  set  forth  :  "  Ut  famili-
arum  dignitas,  nomen  et  ordo  serventur,  et  bona  morien-
tium  in  eorum  agnatos  et  posteros  transmittantur,  per
quos  nomina  generis  conservantur,  statuimus  et  ordi-
namus,"3  &c.

It  would  seem  that  in  Ravenna  the  prolonged  con-
tinuance of  the  Byzantine  rule  had  the  effect  of  sup-
pressing this  preference  of  the   agnates,  and  that  there

the  Novel  of  Justinian  was  in  force.  The  same  was  the
case  at  Osimo.  Adoption  was  of  rare  occurrence  ;
legitimated  children  were  postponed  to  legitimate  ;  natural
children  who,  under  the  influence  of  the  Longobard  law,
had  been  favoured  in  earlier  statutes,  were  afterwards
neglected,  in  consequence  of  the  growing  ascendancy  of
Canon  and  Roman  law.  The  whole  statutory  law  of
succession  is  so  dominated  by  the  political  conception
which,  so  far  from  losing,  is  constantly  gaining  ground,
that  the  disposing  power  of  the  testator — always  extremely
restricted — can  only  arrive  at  a  result  slightly  more  equit-
able and  natural,  but  never  attains  to  absolute  freedom  of
decision  in  the  Roman  sense  of  the  word.  In  this,  as  in
every  branch  of  civil  law,  the  Florentine  Statute  Book,
like  all  the  others,  does  not  present  us  with  a  complete
treatise,  but  only  with  fragments,  the  statutes  making
constant  reference  to  the  Roman  law.

No  woman  succeeds  ab  mtestato  to  her  sons  or
daughters,  when  their  are  direct  descendants  or  ascen-
dants even  in  the  third  degree  ;  and  uncle,  brother,
sister,  son,  or  grandson  of  a  brother  are  preferred  to  her.
Though  excluded  from  succession,  she  can  nevertheless
claim  alimony  from  those  who  by  law  exclude  her.  If
there  be  no  such  relatives,  she  inherits  ab  intestato  one-
fourth  of  her  son's  estate,  provided  it  does  not  amount  to
more  than  five  hundred  lire.  In  any  case,  she  only
receives  money,  not  real  property.  If  there  is  no  money,
she  will  be  entitled  to  the  price  of  the  lands  forming  her
inheritance.  The  same  provisions  apply  when  a  grand-
mother, great-grandmother,  or  descendants  in  the  maternal
line  succeed  ah  intestato.

A  woman  could  not  succeed  ab  intestato  to  a  brother
leaving  children,  grandchildren,  or  brothers  ;  but  when
thus  excluded  from  the  succession,  she  was  still  entitled  to
alimony.     She  could  not  succeed  even  to  her  father  ;  but


A  CTION  OF  POLITICAL  IDEA  UPON  CIVIL  LA  W.    42 1

was  entitled  to  receive  her  dowry  from  the  agnates,  and
could  meanwhile,  even  if  a  widow,  claim  alimony  from
them.  I

It  is  plain  from  all  these  provisions  that  the  woman's
rights  of  succession  were  very  limited  ;  but  she  was
always  insured  of  the  wherewithal  to  live.  We  find,
indeed,  from  the  Florentine  statutes,  that  while  the
preference  given  to  the  agnates  increases  as  time  goes  on,
so  too  the  woman's  rights  to  alimony  increase.  The
statute  of  1355  concedes  to  her  the  usufruct  of  the
paternal  inheritance,  on  failure  of  male  issue,  while  under
the  same  circumstances,  later  statutes  deny  her  this  right,
allowing  her  alimony  instead. 2  Speaking  of  aliment,  and
of  those  bound  to  supply  it,  the  statute  of  1324  says:
•*  Si  filius,  nepos  vel  pronepos  facultatis  abundarent,"3  so
that  they  can  commode  subvenire^  &c. ;  and  the  statute  of
1355  imposes  the  same  obligation,  with  the  same  con-
ditions.4  But  the  printed  statute  of  141 5  is  far  more
explicit ;  the  father,  mother,  grandfather,  grandmother,
great-grandfather,  and  great-grandmother  are  all  entitled
to  alimony,  and  the  Podesta  is  bound  to  enforce  the  law.
The  female  inherits  ab  intestato  from  her  mother  or  other
female  ascendants,  but  only  on  failure  of  male  issue.
Uterine  brothers,  being  of  the  female  line,  cannot  succeed
one  another  should  there  be  relations  of  the  deceased  in
the  male  line  as  far  as  the  fourth  degree, 5  these  being
preferred  to  the  mother  and  relations  in  the  female  line.

»  Statutes  4  (of  1324),  ii.  70,  and  9  (of  1355),  ii.  73,  in  the  State
Archives,  declare  in  fact  that  when  there  are  no  survivin;^  sons,  but  only
brothers  or  their  sons,  the  woman  is  entitled  to  have  the  usufruct  of
her  father's,  grandfather's,  or  great-grandfather's  estate  :  "  Tunc  ipsa
muher  habeat  usufructum  omnium  bonorum  talis  patris,  avi,  vel  proavi
defuncti."  This  is  the  usufruct  for  which  alimony  is  afterwards
substituted.

422   FAMILY  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES.

The  Florentine  statute  goes  on  to  declare  that  the  wife  is
to  be  preferred  to  the  public  treasury,  uxor  mariti  defuncti
-praferatur  fisco ;  showing  how  little  the  woman's  rights
were  considered,  when  an  express  enactment  was  needed
to  prevent  the  revenue  authorities  from  depriving  her  of
her  husband's  estate.  Natural  children  were  also  preferred
to  the  treasury,  which  only  succeeded  on  failure  of  rela-
tions as  far  as  the  fourth  degree.  Relations,  however,
could  succeed  to  bastards,  as  though  these  had  been
legitimate. I  It  should  be  added  that  Florentine  custom
did  not  allow  natural  children  to  be  left  without  some
means  of  support,  or  without  provision  for  their  education,
as  is  shown  by  many  still  existing  wills.  In  the  case  of
males,  the  father  generally  tried  to  obtain  employment  for
them  ;  in  the  case  of  females,  to  find  them  husbands,  and
he  recommended  them  to  the  care  of  his  legitimate  heirs.
The  husband  succeeded  to  his  wife's  dowry,  failing
children  or  other  near  descendants.  Of  her  extra-dotal
property  he  was  entitled  to  one-third,  and  the  wife  could
not  dispose  of  her  dowry  either  by  will  or  donation,  so
as  to  exclude  her  husband  or  children  .2


XIII.

Besides  the  law  of  succession,  there  is  another  branch  of
the  Italian  statutes  in  which  the  action  of  the  political
idea  upon  civil  law  is  equally  apparent,  namely,  that
which  treats  of  rights  between  neighbours,  and  of  the
obligations  in  solidum  attaching  not  only  to  the  members  of
families,  but  likewise  to  the  members  of  sects  and  associa-
tions. We  have  already  observed  that  these  are  carried
so  far  as  to  make  one  member  responsible  for  another's

•  "  Statuta  Florentiae,"  ii.  126.  »  Ibid  ii.  129.


STA TUTOR Y  LAW.  423

debts,  and  even  for  his  delicts  :  this  Is  a  law  to  which
we  shall  have  more  than  once  to  return  and  give  our
'  ^attention.  When  real  property  is  sold,  we  find  that  the
agnates  and  cognates  have  always  a  preferential  right  of
purchase.  In  the  March  of  Ancona,  the  blood-relations
of  a  prisoner  condemned  to  death  may  be  compelled  to
purchase  his  estate. '  At  Bologna,  relations  are  often
made  legally  responsible  for  one  another,  and,  by  the
rules  of  the  corporations  of  merchants  in  that  city,  the
brothers  of  any  bankrupt,  who  have  lived  in  community
with  him  within  a  month  before  his  failure,  are  held
responsible  for  his  debts — even  if  they  have  separated
from  him  since  that  time. 2

According  to  the  Florentine  statute,  the  creditor  of
any  Commune  or  of  any  Universitas  (corporation)  might
proceed  against  it,  sicut  procedi  potest  contra  alias
singulares  perscnas  debitrices^  in  persona.  This  was
carried  so  far,  that  it  was  permissible  to  proceed  against
every  individual  member  of  the  association,  and  even  to
have  him  arrested,  liceat  ipsi  creditori  capi  et  detinere
omnes  et  singulares  personas  dicti  Communis  vel  Univer-
sitatis,  quousque  fuerit  integre  satisf actum. '^  If  landed
property  had  been  laid  waste  or  houses  burnt,  the  pro-
prietor was  entitled  to  compensation  from  the  author  of
the  deed  ;  from  his  associates  {consorti\  were  he  a  noble,
or  from  his  relations,  even  to  the  fourth  degree,  if  a
commoner.  Nay  more,  the  injured  person  might  also
proceed  against  the  Commune,  University,  or  district
\plebatum)  in  which  the  crime  had  been  committed  ;  he
was  at  liberty  to  follow  any  of  these  modes  of  redress,
and  if  unsuccessful  in  one  to  try  another.4     The  statute

prescribed  the  form  of  procedure  and  the  terms  of  the
sentence.!  The  Commune,  University,  or  district  was
thus  compelled  to  be  always  ready  to  raise  the  alarm,
when  similar  acts  were  perpetrated,  and  to  pursue  and
arrest  the  criminal,  since,  in  case  of  failure,  they  were  held
responsible.  2

In  all  matters,  even  such  as  purchases  or  sales,  great
importance  was  assigned  to  the  condition  of  the  persons
concerned.  In  some  cases,  where  land  was  to  be  sold,
the  law  required  that  it  should  be  sold  to  a  neighbour ;
commoners,  however,  were  not  compelled  to  sell  to
magnates.  3  Similarly  no  one  might  buy,  sell,  or  acquire
the  usufruct  of  lands  held  in  common,  or  any  piece  of
land  or  house  touching  another  man's  wall,  without
according  the  joint-owner,  associate,  or  neighbour  the
right  of  pre-emption.4

In  case  of  a  dispute  between  relations  or  associates,  qui
consortes  sint  de  eadem  stirpe^  per  lineam  masculinam  usque
ad  infinitum's  the  judge  was  bound,  at  the  request  of  one
of  the  parties  concerned,  to  leave  the  matter  to  the
decision  of  arbiters  chosen  by  the  parties  themselves;
but  no  plebeian  could  act  as  arbiter  between  nobles.^  In
reviving  a  law  of  much  earlier  date,  the  statute  of  1355
informs  us  that  arbiters  were  therein  mentioned,  as  blood-
relations.7  Whence  it  may  be  inferred  that  similar  com-
promises began  to  be  customary,  at  a  very  remote  period,
between  relations  and  associates  who  voluntarily  selected

s  The  frequent  repetition  of  this  phrase  is  worthy  of  note,  since  it
enables  us  to  understand  the  manner  in  which  associations  were  usually
constituted.

statute  of  earlier  date.

arbiters  from  their  own  group.  Down  to  the  year
1324,  the  custom  had  been  sanctioned  by  law;  at  a  later
time  it  lost  its  primitive  character  of  a  voluntary  and
domestic  agreement,  and  assumed  the  shape  of  a  regular
legal  trial.


XIV.

If  we  now  compare  the  Florentine  Statute  Book  with
those  of  other  Italian  cities,  we  shall  find  it  marked  by
various  distinguishing  characteristics,  chiefly  resulting
from  the  fact  that  in  it  democratic  freedom  was  carried
to  the  farthest  point  obtainable  during  the  Middle
Ages.  Not  only  had  every  feudal  privilege  gradually
disappeared  from  it,  but  the  great  nobles  had  ended  by
finding  themselves  in  a  position  inferior  to  that  of  the
commonalty.  Florence,  as  we  have  already  seen,  was
one  of  the  first  Italian  cities  to  abolish  serfdom  in  her
outlying  territory  by  the  law  of  12 89.1  And  although
her  rural  population  was  always  treated  much  worse  than
the  inhabitants  of  the  city,  it  nevertheless  enjoyed  far
better  conditions  than  prevailed  in  a  great  number  of
communes.  We  have  proof  of  this  in  the  contract  of
Mezzeria^  which  makes  the  cultivator  of  the  soil  an
actual  partner  with  the  proprietor,  and  which  still  remains
a  great  monument  of  civilisation  and  the  cynosure  of
modern  economists  who  have  never  been  able  to  devise
any  better  system.^

'  The  Mezzeria  system  obtains  not  only  throughout  Tuscany  and
Lucca,  but  over  a  considerable  part  of  Romagna,  But  the  terms  and
contracts  most  favourable  to  the  peasantry  are  to  be  found  near  Florence
and  in  the  Pistoian  district.  Contracts  implying  a  system  of  Mezzeria
more  or  less  rudimentary,  and  dating  from  about  the  close  of  the  twelfth
century,  are  still  extant.

426  FAMILY  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES.

The  freedom  and  strength  of  associations,  the  extraor-
dinary ease  with  which  any  one  might  participate  in  the
government  of  the  Commune,  all  contributed  to  the
triumph  of  democracy  on  the  widest  basis.  Another
general  characteristic  to  be  noted,  not  only  in  the  Floren-
tine, but  in  almost  all  the  Italian  statutes,  is  the  constant
endeavour  to  shake  off  the  intervention  of  the  ecclesiastical
authority,  which  labours  with  incredible  obstinacy  to
maintain  its  privileges  undiminished,  and  even  seeks  to
increase  them;  but  which,  nevertheless,  finds  them
gradually  reduced  almost  to  zero.  The  statute  of
141 5  ordains  that  "no  person,  university,  or  church,
no  religious  or  clerical  house  shall  presume  to  question
the  jurisdiction  of  the  Commune  under  pretence  of
*  benefice '  or  privilege,  and  that  any  one  who  opposes
this  enactment  shall  be  imprisoned  until  he  renounce  such
privilege.  I  No  excommunication  nor  interdict  shall  hinder

by  the  Notary  L.  Ticciati,  and  published  by  him  in  the  "  Archivio  Storico
Italiano,"  Series  v.,  vol.  x.,  No.  4,  1892.  Nevertheless,  contracts  on  the
true  Mezzeria  system  cannot  have  been  in  general  use  earlier  than  the
commencement  of  the  fourteenth  century.  A  common  contract  drawn
up  in  133 1  on  Siennese  territory  was  communicated  by  Prof.  C.  Paoli
to  Baron  S.  Sonnino,  and  pubhshed  by  the  latter  in  1875  at  Florence,  in
his  work  "Sulla  Mezzeria  in  Toscana."  In  a  review,  entitled  "L'Agri-
coltura  Italiana,"  nineteenth  year  (1893),  Nos.  274-5,  Marquis  L.  Ridolfi
justly  remarks  that  the  difficulty  in  finding  old  Mezzeria  contracts  in  the
Florentine  territory  proceeds  from  the  custom  prevailing  there  of  seldom
referring  to  a  public  notary  for  the  purpose.  As  a  rule,  the  parties  con-
cerned merely  exchange  written  copies  of  the  asjreement.

DEFECTIVE  IDEA  OF  GOVERNMENT.         427


XV.

Turning  now  to  a  general  view  of  the  Italian  statutes,
we  must  remark  that  although  the  history  of  statutory-
law  presents  many  difficulties,  owing  to  the  infinite
number  of  different  provisions  to  be  found  in  it,  the
diversity  of  these  provisions  is  chiefly  due  to  accidental
and  temporary  causes,  extraneous  to  the  natural  and
spontaneous  development  of  the  law  itself,  which,  examined
apart  and  with  reference  to  its  essential  characteristics,
presents  a  striking  uniformity.  It  may,  however,  be
noted  that  in  the  republics  of  Northern  Italy  the
Longobard  law  is  far  more  predominant ;  while  in  those
of  Central  and  Southern  Italy  Roman  law  obtains  an  early
and  rapid  ascendancy,  and,  subject  to  the  changes  which
have  been  indicated,  ends  by  dominating  at  all  points.
This  progress  becomes  more  apparent  from  year  to  year,
so  that  even  in  examining  the  statutes,  the  very  same
conflict  of  antagonistic  elements  which  we  have  already
noted,  throughout  the  entire  history  of  the  communes  and
of  Italian  civilisation,  is  brought  before  our  eyes  in  civil
wars,  in  sanguinary  struggles  between  Guelphs  and  Ghibel-
lines,  in  art,  in  literature,  in  all  things.  It  is  true  that  the
statutes  only  treat  of  juridical  ideas  and  enactments;  but
these  seem  to  strive  with  the  same  ardour,  and  to  aim  at
the  same  ends,  as  the  men  whom  they  control.

Towards  the  close  of  the  fourteenth  century  Italian
commerce  began  to  make  enormous  advance,  and  this
gave  a  new  impetus  to  Italian  legislation.  In  fact,  we
find  a  series  of  enactments  enabhng  all  mercantile  affairs
to  be  transacted  with  much  greater  celerity,  avoiding
legal  quibbles,  releasing  merchant's  credits  from  mortgage
or  sequestration,  and  severely  punishing  all  frauds  and
fraudulent  bankruptcies.     In  a  word,  we  clearly  discern


428  FAMILY  AND  STATE  TN  ITALIAN  COMAIUNES.

the  inchoation  of  the  modern  commercial  code  with  which
these  enactments  are  frequently  in  unison.

But  in  all  these  laws  we  always  recognise  the  conse-
quences of  commerce  being  divided  and  split  into  a
multitude  of  separate  associations  with  statutes  of  their
own,  judges  of  their  own,  and  an  exuberance  of  vitality.
At  the  same  time,  we  recognise  that  the  central  authority,
though  aware  that  its  natural  rights  are  threatened  and
usurped  on  all  sides,  continues  to  exert  its  influence,
without  method,  indeed,  or  uniformity,  but  not  without
vigour,  and  occasionally  even  with  violence.  At  one
moment  it  seems  to  be  vanquished ;  at  another  it  comes
forth  victorious.  The  entire  history  of  the  Commune
demonstrates  a  constant  tendency  to  harmonise  all  these
distinct  and  often  jarring  elements — political,  social,  and
legislative — but  this  problem  it  never  succeeds  in  solving,
and  ends  by  relapsing  into  despotism.  A  true  conception
of  social  unity  was  wanting  ;  the  idea  of  a  due  distribution
of  authority  was  still  unknown,  either  in  real  life  or  in
theory  ;  accordingly  whoever  happened  to  have  a  share
in  the  executive  authority,  also  assumed,  as  necessarily
connected  with  it,  a  share  not  only  in  judicial,  but  like-
wise in  administrative  and  legislative  functions.  Where-
fore it  seemed  that  the  only  way  to  preserve  liberty  was
to  parcel  out  the  government  among  an  infinity  of  hands,
and  so  to  contrive  that  parties,  associations,  cliques  {con-
sorterie),  families,  and  quarters  of  the  town  should  each
and  severally  serve  as  checks  upon  all  the  others.  In  this
process  of  division  and  subdivision  all  the  elements  after-
wards constituting  modern  society  were  prepared,  but  the
State,  in  its  true  sense,  was  never  discovered.  Without
ballast  to  steady  her,  the  ship  of  the  Commune,  driven
hither  and  thither  in  a  ceaseless  storm  and  buffeted  by
winds  from  all  quarters,  could  neither  find  anchorage  nor
keep  a  settled  course.     No  clear  and  certain  conception


CAUSES  LEADING  TO  DOWNFALL  OF  FREEDOM.  429

was  ever  reached  of  that  law  which,  by  limiting  and
defining  the  amount  of  liberty  guaranteed  to  each  indi-
vidual, secures  freedom  to  all.

The  political  life  of  communes,  moreover,  was  always
confined  within  the  walls  of  the  dominant  cities,  since  not
only  the  outlying  territory  was  excluded  from  it,  but
likewise  all  towns  that  had  been  annexed  or  conquered.
Every  form  of  representative  government  was  as  yet
unknown.  All  who  enjoyed  political  rights  entered,  each
in  his  turn,  the  Councils  of  the  Republic,  and  sooner  or
later  nearly  all  rose  to  power.  This  made  it  necessary
that  the  States  should  have  very  circumscribed  borders,  as
otherwise  it  would  have  been  impossible  to  govern  them
at  all.  The  French  Revolution,  by  achieving  for  the  first
time,  in  behalf  of  the  nation  at  large,  what  the  Italian
communes  had  efi'ected  for  the  cities,  was  able  to  proclaim
the  civil  and  political  equality  of  all  who  formed  part  of
the  nation,  and  who  were  in  consequence  to  be  recognised
as  citizens.  From  that  time  democracy  became  the  pre-
dominant characteristic  of  modern  societies  which,  by
means  of  representative  institutions,  have  found  it  possible
to  secure  freedom,  even  in  large  states,  reconciling  the
unity  and  vigorous  action  of  the  central  government  with
personal  independence  and  with  local  liberty  and  activity.
But  the  Commune  always  wavered  between  the  opposing
elements  of  which  it  was  made  up  and  which  it  never
succeeded  in  fusing  into  a  true  political  organism.

The  history  of  our  republics  may,  in  fact,  be  summed
up  in  an  account  of  the  varying  predominance  of  one  or
other  of  the  great  associations  of  which  they  were  com-
posed. In  Florence,  we  have,  first  of  all,  the  conflict  of
nobles  and  commons  which  is  maintained  with  changing
fortunes.  When  the  fraternities  {consorterie)  of  the
leading  magnates  obtained  such  ascendancy  as  to  menace
popular  liberties  and  destroy  the  social  balance,  notable


430  FAMILY  AND  STATE  IN  ITALIAN  COMMUNES.

reforms  were  made  in  the  statutes  ;  the  Commune  was
completely  transformed,  and  by  means  of  the  Ordinances
of  Justice  (of  which  we  shall  soon  have  to  speak),  the
nobles  were  overthrown  and  their  associations  broken
up.  But  as  these  associations  were  an  integral  part  of
the  State,  their  downfall  was  followed  by  a  phase  of  rapid
corruption  and  decay.  To  the  passions  and  interests  of
caste  succeeded  personal  ambitions,  hatreds  and  passions
of  a  still  more  dangerous  character.  Families  began
to  be  at  strife  ;  men  who  were  at  once  powerful  and
ambitious,  came  to  the  front  ;  and  Corso  Donati,  or
some  other  like  him,  would  have  soon  become  master
and  tyrant  of  the  Republic,  save  for  the  fact  that  a  mighty
people,  enriched  by  the  speedy  gains  of  an  extended
commerce,  devoted  to  freedom  and  opposed  to  the
nobility,  had  first  to  be  disarmed.  Thus  to  the  supremacy
of  the  leagues  of  the  magnates  succeeded  the  predominance
of  the  Greater  Guilds,  between  whom  and  the  Lesser  Guilds
a  struggle  was  entered  upon  in  the  course  of  which  the
latter  obtained,  in  their  turn,  a  share  of  power.  At  a  later
period,  the  populace,  represented  by  the  plebeian  Ciompi,
comes  to  the  front,  and  threatens  the  utter  dissolution  of
the  old  social  form  of  the  Republic.  Then  new  personal
ambitions,  more  fatal  to  freedom  because  more  fortunate,
occupy  the  scene.  The  struggle  between  the  Albizzi,
Pitti,  and  Medici  terminates  in  the  triumph  of  the  last-
named  family  in  the  person  of  Cosimo  the  Elder,  who
slew  the  Republic.  Yet  nothing  of  all  this  should  cause
us  much  surprise.  For  if  we  bear  in  mind  the  beginnings
of  the  Commune  and  the  elements  out  of  which  it  was
constituted,  we  may  readily  see  that  all  that  happened  was,
in  the  main,  unavoidably  bound  to  occur.


CHAPTER  VIII.

THE  ENJCTMENTS  OF  JUSTICE.^

I.

HERE  are  many  reasons  why  the
history  of  Florence  in  the  closing
years  of  the  thirteenth  century  should
demand  our  fullest  attention.  It  was
the  period  of  the  very  important
political  revolution  resulting  in  the
establishment  of  those  Enactments  of  Justice  of  which  the
authorship  is  attributed  to  Giano  della  Bella,  and  which
Bonaini  has  entitled  the  Magna  Charta  of  the  Florentine
Republic.  Even  should  this  comparison  seem  strained,
it  is  certain  that  those  enactments,  sometimes  strengthened,
sometimes  modified,  and  occasionally  suspended,  remained
in  vigour  nevertheless  for  more  than  a  century — a
fact  of  no  small  weight  in  so  mutable  a  common-
wealth as  that  of  Florence.  Sooner  or  later  many
neighbouring  cities  imitated  these  enactments,  and  in
1338  the  Romans  sent  to  request  a  copy  of  them,  in
order  to  re-organise  their  city  by  the  same  means.  On
this  subject  Villani  wrote  as  follows  :  "It  is  known  how
times  and  conditions  change,  for  the  Romans,  who  of  old
built  the  city  of  Florence  and  gave  it  their  own  laws,

'  "  Nuova  Antologia,"  Florence,  July,  1869.
431


432  THE  ENACTMENTS  OF  JUSTICE,

now,  In  our  days,  have  sent  to  ask  laws  from  the  Floren-
tines." I  It  is  likewise  during  this  period  that  we  behold
arts  and  letters  suddenly  blossoming  to  the  greatest
splendour  in  the  bosom  of  the  Republic.  Language,
poetry,  painting,  architecture,  sculpture  had  already  put
forth  their  first  shoots  in  various  Italian  cities  ;  but  all
are  now  permanently  rooted  in  Florence,  and  initiating  a
new  era  in  the  history  of  the  national  intellect,  suddenly
flash  forth  into  a  glory  of  light,  irradiating  all  Europe  as
well  as  Italy.  Hence  it  behoves  us  to  investigate  most
minutely  the  nature  of  the  favourable  conditions,  both
political  and  social,  which  rendered  Florence  the  centre  of
such  marvellous  activity  and  the  focus  of  all  those  far-
spreading  beams.

The  remark  might  certainly  occur,  that  although  this
period  has  such  undoubted  claims  upon  our  attention,  its
history  is  already  very  familiar  to  us  ;  it  has  been  recounted
by  contemporary  writers  such  as  Compagni  and  Villani,
who  were  not  only  eye-witnesses,  but  often  active  partici-
pants in  the  events  they  described  ;  it  has  been  corroborated
by  many  original  documents,  and  recently  expounded
afresh  by  some  most  illustrious  modern  writers.  Never-
theless, the  attentive  student  is  compelled  to  recognise
that  those  times  are  less  well  known  than  might  be
supposed ;  for  even  in  perusing  the  works  of  the  newest
historians  we  are  perplexed  by  numerous  difficulties  and
doubts.  In  point  of  fact,  what  is  it  we  learn  from
Machiavelli,  Ammirato,  Sismondi,  and  Napier,  and  even
from  Vannucci,  Giudici,  and  TroUope,  who  wrote  subse-
quently to  the  publication  of  many  newly  discovered
original  documents.?  That,  after  the  battle  of  Campaldino
the  arrogance  of  the  nobles  in  Florence  exceeded  all
bounds  ;  that  they  insulted,  oppressed,  and  trampled  on
the  people  ;  that  there  arose  a  daring  and  generous  man
»  G.  Villani,  "Cronica,"  xi.  96.


THE  REPUBLICS  POSITION  IN  ITAL  Y.        433

named  Giano  della  Bella,  a  noble  devoted  to  the  popular
party,  who  when  holding  the  office  of  Prior  proposed  a
new  law  as  a  permanent  remedy  for  these  evils  ;  that  this
law  was  passed  and  sanctioned  under  the  name  of  Enact-
ments of  Justice,  and  that  it  excluded  the  nobles — or,
rather,  the  magnates — from  every  political  post ;  that  it
only  permitted  those  really  engaged  in  some  trade  or  craft
to  share  in  the  government  of  the  Republic  ;  that  it
punished  every  grave  offence  against  the  people,  on  the
part  of  the  nobles,  with  exceptionally  severe  sentences  and
penalties,  such  as  chopping  off  hands,  death  at  the  block,
and,  more  frequently,  by  confiscation  of  property  ;  that
slighter  offences  were  only  punished  by  fines  ;  that  the
magistrates  were  empowered  to  chastise  any  man  of  the
people  {popolano)  showing  hostility  to  the  Republic  or
breaking  its  laws,  by  proclaiming  him  a  noble,  and  that  this
sentence  immediately  excluded  him  from  the  government
and  placed  him  under  the  same  restrictions  to  which  aristo-
crats were  subject.  Furthermore,  that  if  any  magnate
convicted  of  offence  should  escape  justice,  one  of  his
relations  or  associates  would  have  to  expiate  the  crime
in  his  stead.  ^

"  A  fact  without  parallel  in  the  world's  history ! "
Giudici  exclaims.  For  truly,  although  a  fundamental
law  of  the  Republic,  this  decree  seems  rather  a  freak
of  revenge  solely   inspired  by  the  blindest    party  spirit.

Trollope  failed  to  overcome  every  difliculty,  he  was  enabled  to  avoid
various  blunders  on  this  head  by  merely  translating  certain  parts  of  the
enactments  without  explaining  the  more  obscure  items.  Mons.  Perrens,
in  a  recent  work,  written  after  the  first  publication  of  this  chapter,  has
generally  accepted  its  conclusions  and  corroborated  them  by  fresh
researches  of  his  own.

434  THE  ENACTMENTS  OF  JUSTICE.

Accordingly  almost  every  word  of  the  decree  excites
our  suspicion.  How  can  it  be  explained  that  Dante
was  one  of  the  Priors  in  office  at  the  time,  together
with  others  who  undoubtedly  were  not  artisans,  or  only
so  in  name,  if  it  were  true  that  the  enactments  excluded
all  who  were  not  practically  exercising  some  trade  ?
And  apart  from  a  thousand  lesser  doubts,  the  fact
that  innocent  men  were  then  condemned  to  death
merely  because  they  were  relations  or  fellow-associates  of
criminals  who  had  escaped  justice,  is  a  point  that  we
cannot  possibly  understand.  In  a  period  of  the  densest
barbarism,  it  would  be  barely  comprehensible  ;  in  Dante's
age,  it  is  a  mystery  and  a  contradiction,  confusing  all  our
ideas  concerning  those  times.  Therefore  renewed  investi-
gation of  the  subject  cannot  be  altogether  futile.  It  is
requisite  to  penetrate  the  true  nature  of  the  revolution
that  had  then  been  accomplished,  and  of  the  law  that
resulted  from  it,  and  to  bring  both  into  harmony  with
the  times  and  with  the  history  of  Florence.


II.

Towards  the  end  of  the  thirteenth  century  the  Repubhc
had  acquired  very  high  importance  throughout  Italy  as
well  as  Tuscany.  The  fall  of  the  Hohenstauffens,  the
coming  of  the  Angevins,  the  vacancy  of  the  Imperial
throne  had  given  an  enormous  ascendancy  to  the  Guelph
party  which  in  Florence  was  that  of  the  democracy.  Its
three  great  Ghibelline  rivals,  Pisa,  Sienna,  and  Arezzo,
had  been  humiliated  and  conquered  by  the  subtle  diplo-
macy of  Florence  and  Florentine  arms  ;  and  these  victories
had  not  only  re-established  the  Republic's  political  authority
in  Tuscany,  but  opened  and  secured  to  it  all  the  chief
highways  of  commerce.     Through  Pisa  it  had  access  to  the


LURKING  DISCORD  IN  THE  STATE.  435

sea  ;  through  Sienna  and  Arezzo,  to  Rome,  Umbria,  and
Southern  Italy  ;  it  could  pass  to  the  north  through  distant
Bologna,  peopled  with  friendly  Guelphs.  Accordingly
the  commerce  of  Florence  was  then  rapidly  increased,
and  this  republic  of  merchants,  surrounded  by  other
republics  equally  devoted  to  trade  and  industry,  stood  at
the  head  of  all  Tuscany.  On  the  other  hand,  however,
the  augmented  power  of  the  Angevins  was  beginning  to
excite  the  jealousy  of  the  Popes  who  had  first  called  them
to  Italy,  and  who  now  turned  their  eyes  towards  Germany
in  order  to  revive  the  Imperial  pretensions,  and  thus  check
the  growing  ambition  of  the  French  king.  For  Charles
of  Anjou,  whom  they  had  named  Senator  of  Rome  and
Vicar-Imperial  of  Tuscany,  now  seemed  determined  to
follow  the  daring  policy  of  the  Swabian  line  by  aspiring
to  supremacy  over  Italy.

During  this  state  of  things,  the  Florentines  managed  to
keep  their  balance  with  marvellous  7?«<?jj<?,  and  by  leaning
this  way,  or  that,  frequently  turned  the  scales  on  the
side  they  preferred.  They  utilised  the  king's  soldiery  to
crush  Ghibelline  cities  and  Ghibelline  nobles  ;  they  leaned
on  the  Pope,  to  check  Charles's  arrogance  ;  and  they
showed  readiness  to  favour  the  Empire,  when  the  Pope
tried  to  assert  temporal  supremacy,  as  though,  in  the
present  interregnum.,  he  were  the  natural  inheritor  of  the
imperial  rights.  By  this  means,  the  Republic  not  only
preserved  its  independence,  but  became  a  State  command-
ing the  fear  and  respect  of  all  Italy.  ^  This  was  all  the
result  of  the  shrewdness,  energy,  and  intelligence  of  its
burghers,  who  governed  with  so  much  thriftiness  and
wisdom  as  to  achieve  an  unparalleled  prosperity.  "  It
is  a  known  thing,"  says  Villani,  "  that  down  to  this  time
and  for  long  past,  such  was  the  tranquillity  of  Florence,

*  Vidt  chaps,  v.  and  vi.  of  the  present  work.


436  THE  ENACTMENTS  OF  JUSTICE.

that  the  City  gates  stood  unlocked  by  night,i  no  duties
were  exacted  in  Florence  ;  2  and  rather  than  impose  bur-
dens, when  money  was  needed,  old  walls  and  bits  of  land
within  and  without  the  City  were  sold  to  the  owners  of
conterminous  portions  of  the  soil."  3  With  few  taxes  and
no  debts,  the  administration  was  excellently  conducted  ;
it  left  the  citizens  unhampered,  and  increased  the  general
well-being.

III.

Nevertheless,  beneath  this  tranquil  surface  the  seeds  or
deep-rooted  discord  lurked  in  the  bosom  of  the  State,  and
occasionally  broke  forth  in  sanguinary  conflicts,  of  which
the  discontent  of  the  nobles  was  the  principal  cause.  It
would  be  a  serious  mistake  to  believe  that  they  were  first
excluded  from  the  government  in  virtue  of  the  Enact-
ments of  Justice.  The  measure  had  been  prepared  long
before,  and  although  not  then  rigorously  carried  out,  may
be  said  to  have  been  already  sanctioned  in  1282,  by  the
decree  placing  the  Priors  of  the  Guild  at  the  head  of  the
Republic.  But  it  should  not  be  thought  on  this  account,
that  the  nobles  had  lost  all  actual  power  in  the  city  at
the  time.  First  of  all,  the  new  system  of  warfare,  in
which  municipal  armies,  composed  of  artisans,  unprovided
with  cavalry  or  men-at-arms,  proved  very  incompetent,
had  made  the  assistance  of  the  nobles  indispensable,  and

'  It  is  impossible  to  believe  that  there  were  no  duties  of  any  kind.
Villani  himself  (bk.  xi.  chap,  xcii.)  enumerates  a  great  many  imposed
between  1336  and  1338,  and  certain  of  these  were  unquestionably  of
earlier  origin.  Perhaps  he  meant  to  express  that  the  duties  were  few
and  slight.

'  "  Per  non  mettere  gravezza."  Whenever  taxes  were  imposed  on  the
property  of  citizens,  an  estimate  was  made  of  it,  as  the  tax  in  question
was  paid  in  lire  or  libbre,  the  term  far  libbra,  allibbrare,  was  often  used  to
signify  making  valuations  of  property  as  well  as  the  imposition  of  taxes.

also  began  to  render  it  necessary  to  employ  foreigners  :
soldiers  of  adventure  from  Germany,  France,  and  Spain,
who  earned  their  living  by  war  alone.  At  Montaperti
(1260)  the  terrible  defeat  of  the  Republic's  Guelph  host
had  been  achieved  by  Manfred's  Germans,  and  the  Ghibel-
line  nobles  banished  from  Florence.  At  Campaldino
(1289)  it  was  Corso  Donati,  Vieri  de'  Cerchi,  and  other
Florentine  nobles  or  potentates  who  had  decided  the  fate
of  the  day.  The  nobles  knew  this,  and  constantly  boasted
of  it,  in  their  contempt  for  the  artisans  and  people.  Being
trained  to  arms,  and  undisturbed  by  commercial  cares,
they  sorely  chafed  against  being  excluded  from  the  govern-
ment by  rougher  folk  far  less  fitted  for  war  than  them-
selves. Accordingly,  political  animosities  became  more
and  more  heated  ;  the  nobles  could  neither  be  still  nor
leave  others  in  peace.

It  should  also  be  remarked  that  the  nobles  of  the  period
were  no  longer  the  feudal  lords  of  former  times,  who,
isolated  in  their  well-guarded  strongholds,  like  so  many
sovereigns,  depended  solely  from  the  Empire  and  were  foes
to  the  Republic.  Having  been  ousted  from  the  territory,
and  obliged  for  some  time  back  to  reside  in  the  city,  they
now  clung  to  the  latter,  but  desired  to  hold  rule  over  it.
Being  surrounded  on  all  sides  by  a  powerful  population
banded  in  trade  guilds  and  masters  of  the  Government ;
being  forcibly  made  subject  to  Republican  laws  refusing  all
recognition  of  feudal  rights,  the  nobles  had  been  obliged,
in  self-defence,  to  form  Associations  or  Societies  of  the
Towers,  which  being  ruled  by  custom  rather  than  law,
were  all  the  more  firmly  knit  together.  Originally,  the
nobles  had  been  chiefly  united  by  family  ties  which  were
still  more  closely  respected  on  the  disintegration  of  the
feudal  order,  when,  in  order  to  maintain  their  strength,
kinsmen  banded  together  in  separate  castes  or  associations
and  gave  admittance  to  a  widening  circle  of  members.

They  clustered  together  in  neighbouring  palaces,  often
lining  one  or  more  of  the  city  streets  ;  they  lived  in  the
midst  of  their  adherents,  squires,  domestics,  and  grooms,
and  in  moments  of  danger  even  summoned  to  their  aid
the  peasantry  of  their  rural  estates.  Their  possessions
were  always  handed  down  to  their  families  or  the  Society
to  which  they  belonged,  and  their  disputes  were  settled
by  chosen  arbiters.  ^  Besides  all  this,  their  deeds  of  ven-
geance were  decided  upon  in  common,  and  the  individuals
charged  to  execute  them  were  always  placed  in  safety
by  their  comrades,  the  whole  association  assuming  the
responsibility  of  every  deed  of  this  kind.  Often,  between
one  house  and  another,  or  in  one  of  their  palace  yards,
there  was  an  archway  under  which  they  administered
torture  to  any  one  they  chose.  In  fact,  speaking  of  the
Bostichi  family,  Compagni  tells  us  that :  "  They  com-
mitted many  evil  deeds,  and  continued  to  do  them  for
long.  In  their  own  palaces,  situated  in  the  New  Market,
in  the  centre  of  the  city,  they  would  string  men  up,  and  put
them  to  the  torture  at  mid-day.  And  it  was  a  common
saying  in  the  land  that  there  were  too  many  tribunals  ;
and  in  counting  the  places  where  torture  was  applied,
people  said:  *In  the  Bostichi  house,  by  the  Market.*  "2
All  this  continued  to  be  done,  notwithstanding  the  very
severe  laws  already  promulgated  against  the  nobles.  A
man  of  the  people  could  be  flogged,  stabbed,  or  tortured,
without  the  author  of  the  misdeed  being  brought  within
the  grasp  of  the  law.  Out  in  the  country  these  same
nobles  used  all  sorts  of  devices  to  perpetuate  serfdom,
although  for  many  years  it  had  been  legally  abolished,
and  by  threats  or  open  violence  induced  their  peasants,

by  means  of  fictitious  contracts,  to  acknowledge  obliga-
tions from  which  they  were  lawfully  exempt.^

Thus  citizens,  already  powerful  in  virtue  of  their  social
position,  contrived  to  retain  much  strength  and  great
political  influence  in  the  Republic,  notwithstanding  the
laws  designed  to  keep  them  in  check.  Being  excluded
from  the  Signory  they  could  neither  enter  the  Council
of  One  Hundred  nor  the  Councils  of  the  Captain,
in  which  the  more  important  questions  were  discussed.
But  they  were  admitted  to  those  of  the  Podesta,
and  this  official,  being  of  necessity  a  knight,  often  gave
judgment  in  favour  of  the  nobles.  Also,  they  were
continually  employed  as  ambassadors,  and  given  the  first
posts  in  war  ;  but  they  enjoyed  most  prominence  in  the
institution  entitled  the  Guelph  Society  (Parte  Guelfa\  and
were  specially  appointed  to  all  its  chief  offices.  This
Society,  founded,  as  we  have  previously  shown,  in  1267,
after  the  expulsion  of  Count  Guido  Novello,  was  charged
with  the  administration  of  all  confiscated  Ghibelline  pro-
perty which  had  been  formed  into  a  monte  or  mobile^  or,
as  would  now  be  said,  capitalised.  This  property  was
to  be  employed  for  the  subjection  of  the  Ghibellines
and  the  support  of  the  Guelphs,  ot  whom  Florence  was
the  Tuscan  headquarters.  It  was  on  this  account  that
Cardinal  Ottavio  degli  Ubandini  had  exclaimed  :  "  Now
that  the  Guelphs  have  formed  a  fund  in  Florence,  the
Ghibellines  will  never  return  there  ; "  and  his  prophecy
was  fulfilled.2     In  fact,  the  Ghibelline  party  was  gradually

swept  away  by  the  steady  persecution  to  which  it  was  sub-
jected on  the  complete  overthrow  of  the  Suabian  line ;  and
Florence,  having  become  exclusively  Guelph,  was  divided
between  the  parties  of  burghers  and  populace,  and  that  of
the  nobles  and  magnates  or  grandi.  The  latter,  although
excluded  from  the  government,  or  from  honours^  to  use  the
phraseology  of  the  time,  could  never  be  ousted  from  the
Guelph  Society,  and  continued  to  administer  its  large
revenues.  This  Society  was  ordered  in  the  fashion  of
a  miniature  republic,  and  notwithstanding  numerous
attempts  to  introduce  an  increasing  burgher  element  within
its  pale,  these  efforts  proved  so  fruitless  and  were  so  invari-
ably thwarted,  that  the  statutes  compiled  in  1335,  and  now
extant  in  print,  record  the  fact  that  money  premiums  were
offered  to  promote  the  nomination  of  new  knights.  To
each  of  the  six  knights  elected  during  the  year  the  sum
of  fifty  gold  florins  were  awarded,  *'  so  that  a  city  of  such
great  magnificence  may  be  duly  glorified  by  the  number
of  its  knights."  Thus  while,  on  the  one  hand,  every
means  was  taken  to  abase  the  great  nobles,  almost  to  the
extent  of  securing  their  extermination,  on  the  other,  this
threatened  class  continually  gained  reinforcement  and
support.*

'  Vide  the  "  Statute  della  Parte  Guelfa,"  chap,  xxxix.  It  may  be  found
in  vol.  i.  (1857)  of  the  "  Giornale  storico  degli  Archivi  Toscani,"  that  was
published  for  some  years  jointly  with  the  "Arch.  Stor.  It."  This  statute
of  1355  (edited  by  Bonaini)  is  the  earliest  known  statute  of  the  Parle
Guelfa,  but  does  not  appear  to  be  the  first  that  was  compiled.  In  the
above-mentioned  "Giornale,"  vol.  iii.  (1859),  Bonaini  began  a  monograph,
entitled,  "  Della  Parte  Guelfa  in  Firenze,"  which  was  continued  in
several  numbers,  but  then  left  incomplete.  Vide  also  G.  Villani,  vii.  17,
describing  the  original  formation  of  the  Society.  Its  precise  condition
in  1293  is  as  yet  imperfectly  known,  but  this  may  be  inferred  from  what
it  was  shortly  before  and  after  that  period.


EFFORTS  IN  FAVOUR  OF  UNITY  AND  CONCORD.  441

IV.

With  all  these  advantao-es,  had  the  nobles  been  united,
they  might  have  regained  their  position  even  after  the
defeats  of  '66  and  '82  and  succeeded  in  dominating  the
people.  But  they  were  divided,  and  hotly  at  strife  even
among  themselves.  *'  There  was  much  warfare  "  (Villani
says)  '*  between  the  Adimari  and  Tosinghi,  between  the
Rossi  and  Tornaquinci,  between  the  Bardi  and  Mozzi,
between  the  Gherardini  and  Manieri,  between  the  Caval-
canti  and  Buondelmonti,  and  likewise  between  certain  of
the  Buondelmonti  and  Giandonati ;  between  the  Visdomini
and  Falconieri,  between  the  Bostichi  and  Foraboschi,
between  the  Foraboschi  and  Malespini,  and  among  the
Frescobaldi  themselves,  and  between  the  members  of  the
Donati  family,  and  also  among  those  of  many  other
houses."*  Nor  is  it  surprising  that  such  strong  and
powerful  cliques  should  have  felt  jealous  of  one
another.  Added  to  this,  the  Guelph  nobles  included
the  remains  of  the  Ghibelline  party,  which  cherished
Imperial  tendencies  ;  thus  another  germ  of  discord  was
sown  that  encouraged  and  excited  the  people  to  prosecute
the  war  of  extermination  it  had  already  set  on  foot.
The  popular  party  was  far  better  organised  and  united  ;
it  was  banded  in  various  guilds  forming  part  of  the
general  constitution  of  the  State,  and  on  every  occasion
showed  an  energy  and  singleness  of  purpose  never  pos-
sessed by  nobles.  It  is  true,  that  even  at  this  juncture,
some  seeds  of  jealousy  were  beginning  to  be  discernible
between  the  greater  and  lesser  guilds  and  the  populace  ;
but  open  discord  was  long  delayed.  For  the  moment  there
was  no  hint  of  it.     Certain  special  conventions,  drawn  up

in  regular  documentary  form,  had  been  arranged  between
the  members  of  one  or  more  of  the  guilds,  and  these
agreements  were  designated  at  the  time  Legbe,  Posture^  or
Convegni.  But  their  object  was  chiefly  commercial,  being
designed  to  keep  the  price  of  certain  commodities  up  to  a
forced  standard,  and  create  illegal  monopolies,  and  was
seldom  the  result  of  political  interests  or  animosities.
They  were  not  sanctioned  by  law,  they  certainly  did  not
promote  concord,  but  their  importance  was  slight.

Thus  the  city  became  increasingly  divided  and  sub-
divided into  groups,  and  was  apparently  in  danger  of
falling  to  pieces.  The  lower  classes  were  still  un-
doubted rulers  of  the  government,  but  the  nobles  were
also  powerful,  if  in  a  different  way;  hence  unity  and
concord  were  continually  and  seriously  imperilled.
Necessarily,  therefore,  the  chief  aim  to  be  pursued,  in
order  to  avert  a  catastrophe,  was  the  attainment  of  greater
equality  among  the  citizens,  of  greater  union  and  strength
in  the  various  societies  as  well  as  in  the  government  itself.
In  fact,  for  a  long  time  past,  Florentine  legislation  and
successive  revolutions  had  alike  kept  this  object  in  view.
The  law  of  August  6,  1289,  abolishing  serfdom  in  order
to  emancipate  the  peasantry,  was  also  another  step  towards
equality.  Those  of  June  30,  and  July  3,  1290,  prohibited
all  agreements  in  any  way  opposed  to  the  lawful  constitu-
tion of  the  guilds.  The  law  of  January  31,  1 2  9 1 ,  imposed
a  fresh  check  on  the  nobles,  by  obliging  all  citizens,  with-
out any  exception,  to  submit  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the
regular  courts,  and  decreeing  the  severest  penalties  on  any
one  asserting,  or  trying  to  obtain,  the  privilege  of  trial  by
special  tribunals.  ^

But  a   more  notable  point  is  the  fact  that  every   fine

*  The  first  of  these  laws,  already  known  to  the  public,  and  the  others

GIANO  BELLA  BELLA.  443

decreed  in  such  cases  fell  upon  the  fellow-associate  or
relation  of  the  criminal,  should  the  latter  contrive  to
evade  justice.  However  strange  this  rule  may  appear  to
the  modern  mind,  its  explanation  is  to  be  found  in  the
account  we  have  already  given  of  the  mode  in  which
property  was  held  at  the  time,  and  of  the  constitution  of
families  and  associations.  When  almost  the  whole  of  the
patrimony  was  shared  by  the  family  in  common,  it  would
have  been  very  difficult,  and  even  dangerous,  to  inflict  a
fine  on  any  one  member  of  the  house  while  exempting  the
rest,  and  for  this  reason  the  invariable  tendency  of  the  law
was  to  insist  on  their  solidarity.  This  principle  seemed  still
more  logical  when  it  was  a  question  of  inflicting  fines  on
nobles  banded  in  closely  united  associations,  and  who,
keeping  all  their  interests  in  common,  decided  on  acts  of
vengeance,  and  proved  their  intention  of  holding  all  things
in  common  and  dividing  one  another's  responsibilities.
Where  property  belonged  to  the  whole  family,  it  was  only
just  that  the  whole  family  should  be  liable  for  the  fine;
where  an  act  of  vengeance  was  done  in  common,  and  the
gravest  offences  committed  in  the  name,  and  with  the
sanction,  of  the  whole  kindred,  there  could  be  nothing
extraordinary  in  the  law  compelling  one  associate  or  kins-
man to  be  mulcted  in  lieu  of  another,  beginning  with  his
nearest  relations.  Precisely  for  these  reasons,  it  had  long
been  customary  in  drawing  out  the  list  of  the  nobles,  for
the  law  to  compel  the  said  nobles  to  sodare^  that  is,  to
compel  every  one  of  them  to  stand  surety  not  merely  for
himself  alone,  but  also  for  his  relations,  by  depositing  the
sum  of  two  thousand  lire.  In  this  way,  since  money-
penalties  seldom  exceeded  the  said  amount,  whenever  a
noble  was  fined  he  could  use  the  money  he  had  already
deposited,  or  it  could  be  employed  for  the  same  end  by
the  kinsman  bound  surety  for  him,  in  case  he  should  have
escaped  or  contrived  to  evade  the  law  by  some  unauthor-

ised  device.  I  These  were  exclusively  and  precisely  the
principles  upon  which  the  Enactments  of  Justice  were
also  founded.  Accordingly  it  is  impossible  to  consider
them  the  personal  invention  of  Giano  della  Bella,  seeing
that  they  were  merely  a  logical  consequence  and  natural
result,  inevitably  evolved  from  preceding  revolutions,
institutions,  and  laws.  Indeed,  for  the  most  part  they
only  sum  up  and  arrange  older  laws,  so  as  to  accentuate
more  plainly  their  primary  and  enduring  intent.


V.

Giano  della  Bella  was  neither  a  legislator  nor  a  politician,
but  a  man  of  action.  A  noble  by  birth,  he  had  fought  at
Campaldino,  where  his  horse  was  killed  under  him;  he
afterwards  joined  the  popular  side,  by  reason,  it  was
averred,  of  a  quarrel  at  San  Piero  Scheraggio  with  Piero
Frescobaldi,  who  had  dared  to  strike  him  in  the  face,  and
threaten  to  cut  off  his  nose.2  Whether  this  tale  were  true
or  not,  it  is  certain  that  Giano  was  a  man  of  violent  dis-
position, great  daring,  small  prudence,  and  disinterested
love  of  freedom ;  but  he  was  by  no  means  devoid  of  the
passion  for  revenge  that  even  his  admirers  laid  to  his
charge.  "  A  forcible  and  very  spirited  man  "  (says  Com-
pagni),  "  he  was  so  daring,  that  he  defended  matters  for-
saken by  others,  said  things  others  left  unspoken,  did  his
utmost  to  bring  justice  to  bear  on  the  guilty,  and  was  so

•  In  fact  the  "  Ordinamenti "  (rubric  xviii.  of  the  Bonaini  edition)  refer
to  this  law,  dated  October  2,  1286  ("  Provvisioni,"  i.  27),  and  comprised
in  the  statute.  Both  the  rubric  and  title  are  quoted  in  the  "  Ordi-
namenti." A  Consulta  (or  decree)  of  March  20,  1280  (81),  given  in
Gherardi's  collection,  p.  33,  had  also  cited  a  similar  and  still  older  law  :
"  De  securitatibus  prestandis  a  magnatibus,''  which  was  afterwards
amended  by  that  of  1286.

much  feared  by  the  Rectors  that  they  dared  not  conceal
evil  deeds."i  According  to  Villani  "  he  was  a  most
loyal  and  upright  popolano^  and  more  devoted  to  the  public
good  than  any  man  in  Florence,  one  that  gave  help  to  the
Commune  without  seeking  his  own  profit.  He  was  over-
bearing and  obstinate  in  wreaking  revenge,  and  also  achieved
some  deeds  of  vengeance  on  his  neighbours,  the  Abati,  by
using  the  authority  of  the  Commune,"  2  for  which  the
worthy  chronicler  severely  blames  him.

When  appointed  Podesta  of  Pistoia,  he  immediately
plunged  into  party  strife,  persecuting  one  side  and  favour-
ing the  other,  with  so  much  ardour  that,  instead  of  fulfill-
ing his  duty  of  pacifying  the  different  factions,  he  inflamed
their  hatred  to  such  a  pitch  that  it  was  impossible  for  him
to  remain  there  to  the  end  of  his  official  term.3  The
whole  course  of  his  conduct  in  Florence  proves,  as  we
shall  see,  that  he  must  have  been  a  man  of  scant  prudence
and  great  impulsiveness.  It  was  precisely  these  charac-
teristics which  made  him  a  leader  of  the  people  instead  of  a
legislator,  and  likewise  an  implacable  enemy  of  the  nobles.

After  the  battle  of  Campaldino  the  latter  showed  more
audacity  and  growing  insolence.  "  It  was  we  who  won  the
victory  at  Campaldino,"  they  continually  repeated,"  and  yet
you  seek  our  ruin."  Bent  on  forcing  their  way  to  the
front  and  gaining  command,  they  daily  insulted  or  injured
some  man  of  the  people.  The  law  was  powerless  against
them,  inasmuch  as  the  offenders  could  never  be  unearthed  ;
the  latter  were  carefully  sheltered,  and  no  one  desired  or
dared  to  testify  against  them.  A  popolano  could  be  sur-
rounded, attacked,  even  stabbed,  yet  nobody  had  seen  the
doer  of  the  crime.  Or  some  one  would  be  dragged  into
the  houses  of  an  association,  maltreated,  beaten  or  tortured
on  the  cord,  yet  all  that  occurred  in  those  places  remained

unrevealed.  If  some  noble  was  condemned  to  a  fine,  he
made  haste  to  declare  that  he  possessed  no  separate  estate,
and  by  his  own  negligence,  or  that  of  the  magistrates,  had
failed  to  give  surety,  while  his  relations  repeated  the  same
story.  I  Hence  it  was  necessary  to  recall  the  old  laws  into
vigour,  make  them  still  stricter,  and  decide  on  new  and
sterner  measures.  So  at  last  the  priors  in  office  from
the  15th  of  December,  1292,  to  the  15th  of  February,
1293,  urged  on  by  the  public  voice,  under  Giano's  guid-
ance, commissioned  three  citizens,  Donato  Ristori,  Uber-
tino  della  Strozza,  and  Baldo  Aguglioni,  to  frame  a  new
law  fitted,  not  only  to  meet  present  dangers,  but  to  assure
greater  stability  to  the  Republic  in  the  future.  On  the
loth  of  January,  the  Bill  being  then  drawn  up,  the  Cap-
tain of  the  People  assembled  the  Council  of  One  Hundred,
and  proposed  that  the  required  Councils  should  be  asked
to  grant  them  full  powers  {balm)  2  to  proclaim  it,  if  it
were  approved  by  the  magistrates  and  by  certain  citizen
worthies.  Some  proposed,  in  amendment,  that  it  should
be  first  read  and  discussed  by  the  councils ;  but  this
would  have  entailed  a  risk  of  the  whole  thing  coming  to
nothing.  Accordingly  the  more  practical  course  was
chosen,  and  by  seventy-two  votes,  against  two  negatives
only,  the  requested  balla  was  granted.  On  the  i8th  or
January  the  new  law,  entitled  "Ordinamenti,"  or  "  Ordini
di  Giustizia,"  was  proclaimed  in  the  names  of  the
Podesta,  captain,  and  priors,  and  with  the  concurrence  of
the  Heads  of  the  Twenty-one  Guilds  and  certain  citizen
worthies. 3  There  is  every  reason  to  believe  that  Giano
della   Bella  was   one   of  the  worthies   in  question  ;  but

'  In  fact,  many  neglected  to  give  surety  (sodare),  and  several  laws
were  framed  to  compel  the  contumacious  to  obey.

'  This  is  known  from  the  terms  of  the  debate,  which  has  been  pub-
lished by  Bonaini  in  the  "Arch.  Stor.  It.,"  New  Series,  vol.  i.  p.  78,
document  B.

DIFFERENT  COMPILATIONS.  447

although  historians  suppose  him  to  have  been  the  creator
and  initiator  of  the  law,  since,  as  leader  of  public  opinion,
he  compelled  the  Signory  to  pass  it,  yet  he  was  not  in
the  government  at  the  time,  nor  does  his  name  appear  in
any  official  decree.^  Therefore  he  was  by  no  means  the
sole  author  or  compiler  of  the  new  law.


VI.

What,  then,  are  these  enactments  ?  In  replying  to  this
question  it  is  requisite  to  leave  the  historians  aside  and
turn  to  the  law  itself.  But  there  are  several  old  compilations
of  it,  differing  so  much  from  each  other,  that  one  form  only
comprises  twenty-two  rubrics,  whereas  some  have  more
than  a  hundred.  Accordingly,  the  first  thing  to  be  done
is  to  ascertain  which  is  the  genuine  and  primary  law  passed
on  the  1 8th  of  January,  1293,  since  on  this  alone  can  an
accurate  judgment  be  based,  and  no  other  starting-point
is  possible.  There  are  six  of  these  very  different  compila-
tions— four  in  print,  and  two  still  inedited.  Two  of  the
number  may  be  summarily  dealt  with  as  unnecessary  to  our
purpose.  One  is  included  in  the  general  collection  of
Florentine  statistics,  formed  in  141 5  by  Bartolommeo
Voipi  and  Paolo  de  Castro,  and  printed  with  the  false  date
of  Friburg,  towards  the  close  of  the  eighteenth  century
(177 8- 1783).  This  consists  of  laws  of  entirely  different
periods  arranged  haphazard,  without  regard  to  chronology,
and  including  the  enactments,  but  these  are  given  with
all  the  modifications  and  changes   introduced  at    a  later

'  Many  historians  assert  that  he  was  among  the  priors  when  the
"Ordinamenti"  were  compiled.  But  these  are  officially  dated  the  i8th
of  January,  and  Compagni  states  that  Giano  entered  the  Signory  on  the
15th  of  February.  This  statement  is  supported  by  the  list  of  priors  given
by  Coppo  Stefani,  in  his  "  Delizie  degU  Eruditi  Toscani,"  and  likewise
by  documentary  evidence.


448  THE  ENACTMENTS  OF  JUSTICE.

date,  and  are  also  confusedly  jumbled.  No  historian
engaged  on  the  times  of  Giano  della  Bella  can  make  any
use  of  a  collection  of  this  kind,  since  it  shows  no  proof
of  authenticity.  For  the  same  reason  we  may  also  reject
the  Miscellany  preserved  in  the  Florence  Archives,  and
that  Bonaini  calls  "  a  huge  medley^''  containing  unconnected
laws  of  different  periods,  and  different  tendencies,  some
enforcing  and  others  modifying  the  Enactments  of  Justice.
Hence,  while  possibly  of  some  importance  with  regard  to
the  history  of  the  "  Ordinamenti,"  this  Miscellany  cannot
help  us  to  discover  their  primary  form.

Four  other  compilations  remain,  one  of  which  only  is
inedited.  Examination  quickly  shows  that  the  one  brought
out  by  Bonaini  comprises  no  more  than  twenty-one  rubrics,
and  that  the  last  of  these,  forming  a  general  summary,
is  mutilated  ;  the  other  compilations  contain  a  greater
number  of  rubrics,  but,  in  all  three,  the  general  special
enactments  of  January,  1293,  are  invariably  given  under
the  first  twenty-eight  rubrics.^  In  fact,  from  the  twenty-
ninth  forward,  appendices  and  posterior  laws  begin  to  occur,
often  separately  dated,  and  seemingly  tacked  on  to  the
enactments,  in  order  sometimes  to  modify,  sometimes  to
strengthen  them,  or  again  to  diminish  their  effect,  or
because  of  their  relation  to  cognate  matters.  All  the
laws  and  statutes  of  the  Republic  suffered  more  or  less  the
same  fate.  Thus  the  notable  divergences  found  in  the
various  compilations  are  reduced  to  very  narrow  limits  as
regards  the  original  body  of  enactments.  Certain  doubts  still
assail  us,  however,  seeing  that  we  not  only  find  twenty-
two  rubrics  on  the  one  hand  against  twenty-eight  on  the
other,  but  because  these  rubrics  clash  on  various  points.
First  of  all,  then,  let  us  remark  that  the  oldest  compila-

'  Another  inedited  compilation  also  exists  in  the  Florence  Archives.
Certain  new  rubrics  were  inserted  in  this  at  a  later  date,  and  even,  as  we
shall  show  further  on,  among  the  first  twenty-eight.

tion  is  undoubtedly  the  one  published  by  Bonaini  in  1855,
from  the  original  MS.  in  the  State  Archives.  The  editor
felt  assured  of  having  discovered  the  original  document  of
the  enactments,  but  conscientiously  preferred  to  entitle  it
the  original  draft,=t  seeing  that,  as  Hegel  has  since  ascer-
tained, it  is  not  the  actual  law  that  was  approved
and  proclaimed  by  the  magistrates.  The  codex  is  of
great  antiquity,  and  may  be  ascribed  to  Giano  della
Bella's  day.  In  fact,  in  one  heading,  first  inscribed  and
then  cancelled,  we  find  the  date  of  1292  de  mense  ianuarii
(1293,  new  style). 2  The  usual  formula  heading  all
decrees  of  the  Republic  is  missing,  and  the  said  formula
not  only  gave  the  date  and  title,  but  occasionally  added
the  names  of  the  magistrates  promulgating  the  law.  The
codex  is  of  small  size,  full  of  erasures,  alterations,  and
additions  written  by  different  hands  :  often,  too,  there  are
empty  spaces  left  between  one  rubric  and  another  to  allow
room  for  future  additions  or  corrections.  Everything
plainly  shows  that  this  old  codex  is  only  a  rough  copy  of
the  law,  standing  exactly  as  it  was  drawn  up,  at  the  request
of  the  magistrates,  by  the  three  previously  mentioned
citizens,  and  before  it  had  been  cast  in  its  final  form,  or
legally  sanctioned  by  those  charged  to  discuss  and  approve
it,  prior  to  its  promulgation.  Accordingly  it  is  impossible
to  decide  with  any  certainty  whether  it  was  modified  at
all,  or  in  what  degree.  But  although  this  rough  draft  is
somewhat  anterior  to  the  actual  law  itself,  the  existing
;  compilations  are  all  posterior  to  it,  and  may  consequently
\  include    later    appendices  and    modifications.     Thus,    on

This  is  a  Prolusion,  in  which  the  learned  author  of  the  "  Storia  della  Costi-
tuzione  dei  Municipi  Italiani,"  very  carefully  examines  the  code  edited  by
Bonaini,  and  compares  it  with  others.  But  he  does  not  investigate  the
value  or  intrinsic  importance  of  the  enactments,  and  merely  gives  a  brief
summary  of  them.

4SO  THE  ENACTMENTS  OF  JUSTICE.

examining  the  Latin  compilation  edited  by  Fineschi  in
1790,  and  the  Italian  one  brought  out  by  Giudici
in  1853,  both  derived  from  old  and  authentic  manu-
scripts, we  find  each  to  have  all  the  characteristics  of  a
regularly  proclaimed  law.  Both  begin  with  the  official
formula,  and  are  dated  the  i8th  of  January,  1292  (1293,
new  style).  On  reading  the  rubrics  appended  to  the
second  (the  Italian  copy),  which  is  much  longer  than
the  other,  we  find  various  dates  given,  including  that
of  1324;  whereas  the  first  (the  Latin  version)  contains
none  later  than  the  6th  of  July,  1295.  Therefore  the
latter  is  the  older  of  the  two,  and  the  occasional  diver-
gences existing  even  among  its  first  twenty-eight  rubrics
are  undoubtedly  caused  by  amendments  introduced  at  a
subsequent  time.  Nevertheless,  even  the  first  rubrics  of
the  Latin  compilation  evidently  contain  modifications  of
an  earlier  date  than  the  6th  of  July,  1295.  For  instance,
in  rubric  vi.  we  find  the  number  of  witnesses — a  point  left
undecided  in  the  rough  draft  (rubric  v.) — fixed  at  three  in
the  two  posterior  compilations,  and  this  point  (as  we  shall
see)  can  be  proved  on  documentary  evidence  to  have  been
settled  by  law  in  July,  1295.  Therefore  we  are  justified
in  concluding  that  it  is  the  Latin  and  older  com-
pilation that  gives  the  enactments  as  they  stood  in  July,
1295  ;  while  the  Italian  copy,  although  proved,  by
examination  of  the  codex,  to  be  an  official  translation,
occasionally  includes  alterations  of  even  a  later  date  than
1295.  If,  however,  we  only  keep  in  view  their  first
twenty-eight  rubrics,  and  collate  these  with  Bonaini's
draft,  it  will  be  seen  that,  saving  for  the  non-appearance
in  the  latter  of  six  rubrics,  chiefly  of  a  very  insignificant
kind,  all  other  divergences  are  rather  formal  than  sub-
stantial. In  any  case,  v/herever  the  three  versions  are
found  to  agree,  we  may  be  sure  of  possessing  the  law
passed  on  the  18th  of  January,  1293,  in  the  precise  shape


NATURE  AND  PURPOSE  OF  THE  ENACTMENTS.    451

it  wore  at  the  time  ;  but  wherever,  on  the  contrary,  diver-
gences exist,  we  must  seek  the  aid  of  the  chroniclers  and
of  any  new  documents,  should  such  be  found,  before
arriving  at  a  definite  conclusion.

Following  these    rules,   we  may   therefore  proceed  to
examine  the  law.^

'  Until  this  draft  was  published,  we  could  only  refer  to  posterior
compilations,  and  had  no  means  of  ascertaining  to  what  extent  they
differed  from  the  law  in  its  original  form.  Although  Bonaini  had  failed  to
discover  the  original  document  of  the  law  as  approved,  his  publication
of  the  first  draft  brings  us  very  near  to  the  real  thing.  And  this  is  a
point  of  no  small  importance,  seeing  that  the  laws  of  the  Florentine
Republic  underwent  such  radical  changes  from  one  day  to  another,  that
a  compilation,  dated  only  two  or  three  years  after  the  original  law,  might
be  very  different  from  it.  For  instance.  Document  A,  published  by
Bonaini  ("  Arch.  Stor.  It.,"  New  Series,  vol.  i.  p.  72),  contains  a  rider  or
addendum  to  the  Ordinamenti  passed  on  the  9th  and  loth  of  April,  1293.
This  was  inserted  as  part  of  the  original  law  in  the  compilations  edited
by  Fineschi  and  Giudici.

In  the  following  bibliographical  notices  I  shall  be  obliged,  for  the  sake
of  greater  clearness,  to  occasionally  repeat  or  sum  up  previously  related
facts.

1.  Of  the  various  compilations  of  the  enactments,  that  included  among
the  printed  statutes  was  the  first  to  be  pubHshed.

2.  P.  F.  Vincenzo  Fineschi  published  a  second  compilation  in  his
"  Memorie  storiche,  che  possono  servire  alle  vite  degli  uomini  illustri  di
Santa  Maria  Novella,"  &c.,  P'lorence,  1790.

3.  The  third  pubhshed  compilation  was  given  by  Prof.  P.  E.  Giudici
in  the  appendix  to  his  "Storia  dei  Municipi  Italiani,"  Florence,  Poli-
grafia  italiana,  1853  ;  reprinted  in  3  vols.,  Florence,  Le  Monnier,  1864-66.
The  Itahan  compilation,  divided  in  118  rubrics,  the  last  of  which  is
mutilated,  was  published  from  a  codex  in  the  State  Archives  of  Florence
("  Statuti,"  No.  8).  By  some  oversight  the  author  chanced  to  omit  the
three  concluding  rubrics.

4.  The  last  pubhshed  compilation  is  that  brought  out  by  Bonaini  in
the  "Arch.  Stor.  It.,"  New  Series,  vol.  i.  No.  i,  1855,  of  which  we  have
already  spoken,  and  shall  have  to  mention  again  farther  on.

5.  Another  compilation,  to  which  previous  allusion  has  been  made
(p.  89,  note  i),  is  also  deserving  of  notice.  It  is  among  the  MSS.  of
the  Florence  Archives  (ch.  ii.,dist.  i.,  No.  i),  and  is  still  inedited.  Padre
Ildefonso  published  certain  fragments  of  it,  however,  in  vol.  ix.  of  the
"  Delizie  degli  Eruditi  Toscani,"  and  Bonaini  published  an  index  of  its
rubrics,  134  in  number.

_  6.  In  conclusion,  we  may  mention  the  Miscellany  or  *'  Zibaldone,"
likewise  referred  to  before,  which  in  addition  to  many  decrees  issued
between  1274  and  1465,  some  of  which  augment  the  force  of  the  enact-

What,  then,  were  these  Enactments  of  Justice,  as  origin-
ally framed,  and  what  is  to  be  learnt  from  them  ?  They
work  a  political  and  social  change  in  the  Republic,  for
the  evident  purpose  of  promoting  civil  equality,  giving
greater  unity  to  the  government  and  increased  strength
to  the  guilds  ;  also  of  assuring  the  harmony  and  concord
of  the  people,  and  curbing  the  arrogance  of  the  nobles.
The  more  strictly  political  reform  is  confined  to  establish-
ing safe  rules  for  the  election  of  Priors,  and  creating  a
new  and  more  powerful  magistrate,  the  Gonfalonier  of
Justice,  to  sit  in  junction  with  the  Priors.

By  request  of  the  Captain  of  the  People,  the  Priors
authorised  him  to  call  a  meeting  of  the  Heads,  or  Consuls
of  the  Twelve  Guilds,  in  order  to  deliberate  as  to  the

ments,  also  includes  a  petition  presented  by  the  people  of  Florence  in
June,  1378 — namely,  the  year  in  which  the  Revolt  of  the  Ciompi  occurred,
imploring  that  the  Enactments  of  Justice  should  be  again  enforced,  the
which  request  was  granted.  This  codex  is  also  a  useful  contribution  tcj
the  history  of  the  enactments.

Recently  both  Prof.  Del  Lungo  {vide  "  Bullettino  delle  Societa  Dan-I
tesca,"  Nos.  10,  11,  of  July,  1892)  and  Sig.  G.  Salvemini,  undergraduat^
of  the  Institute  Superior,  Florence  {vide  "Arch.  Stor.  It.,"  Series  v
vol.  X.  1892),  have  published  the  provision  of  July  6,  1295,  introducinj
several  modifications  and  mitigations  in  the  enactments.  Although  thii
provision  was  already  known  to  the  world,  by  Prof.  Del  Lungo's  previoui
careful  examination  of  it  in  his  work  on  "  Dino  Compagni ''  (vol  i,
1078-80),  Salvemini's  clever  commentary  has  gleaned  fresh  informatioi
from  it.  This  provision  includes  all  the  modifications  made  in  the  enact
ments  in  1295,  and  often  gives  fragments  of  the  law  as  it  previously  stooc
together  with  the  changes  then  introduced.  Hegel,  having  examined  al
the  documents  edited  in  his  day,  was  the  first  to  prove,  on  assurec
evidence,  that  the  rough  draft  edited  by  Bonaini,  although,  as  h
thinks,  omitting  certain  rubrics  and  comprising  some  disparities
mostly  of  form,  contained  the  real  gist  of  the  original  enactment!
This  in  itself  was  an  important  result.  Regarding  the  disparitie
noted  by  Hegel,  and  the  missing  rubrics,  Salvemini  was  enabled,  b
studying  the  document  of  July  6,  1295,  to  make  some  novel  remark:
to  which  we  ^all  refer  later  on.

safest  and  most  fitting  mode  of  choosing  their  own  succes-
sors. All  candidates  to  the  priorate  had  to  be  enrolled  in
some  guild,  and  to  exercise  its  trade,  as  the  surest  means

i.  of  proving  that  they  were  not  of  the  aristocracy — always
the  chief  point  to  be  ascertained.  In  fact  no  one  remain-
ing  a  noble  could  be  eligible   to   the    Signory,    even    if

0  engaged  in  trade.  ^  By  means  of  subtle  and  often  quibbling
interpretations  of  the  law,  it  was  possible  to  compromise
as  to  the  actual  practice  of  a  craft,  but  never  as  to  being
absolutely  free  from  all  taint  of  aristocracy.^  Thus
Giano  della  Bella,  in  spite  of  merely  having,  as  Villani
relates,  some  slight  commercial  interests  in  France,  was
qualified,  on  discarding  his  rank  and  becoming  one  of
the  people,  to  enter  the  Signory  in  February,  1293.  In
July,  1295,  as  we  shall  see,  the  enactments  were  modified,
and  it  was  sufficient  for  candidates  to  be  enrolled  in  some
guild  without  practically  exercising  its  trade,  always  pro-
viding they  did  not  belong  to  the  nobility.  Many  regula-
tions were  added  to  assure  an  equal  division  of  public
posts  among  all  the  Sestieri  of  the  city  and  all  the  guilds,
while  prohibiting  the  nomination  of  several  Priors  belong-
ing to  the  same  Sestiere,  family,  or  guild.  None  leaving
office  could  be  re-elected  to  it  within  two  years,  and  this
prohibition  was  extended  to  his  relations  as  well.  The
office  of  Prior  was  held  for  two  months ;    no  one  was

»  Rubric  iii.  of  the  draft  states  that  "  De  prudentioribus,  melioribus
et  legalioribus  artificibus  civitatis  Florentiae,  continue  artem  exercen-
tibus,  dummodo  non  sint  milites."  Also  farther  on  :  "  Aliquis  qui
!!  continue  artem  non  exerceat,  vel  aliquis  miles  non  possit  nee  debeat
niodo  aliqui  eligi,  vel  esse  in  dicto  officio  Prioratus."  "  Arch.  Stor.  It.,"
New  Series,  vol.  i.  pp.  44,  45.  Rubric  xviii.,  p.  66,  enumerates  the
persons  bound  to  give  guaranty  as  nobles,  although  exercising  a  trade,
"non  obstante  quod  ipsi  vel  aliquis  eorum  de  dictis  domibus  et  casatis
.  .  .  sint  artifices  vel  artem  sen  mcrcantiam  exerceant."

*  Vide  on  this  point  a  document  of  1287  appended  to  this  chapter.
It  proves  that  the  practical  exercise  of  a  trade  or  craft  was  held
indispensable  before  1293,  and  shows  what  precautions  were  required  to
prevent  the  law  from  being  easily  evaded.

allowed  to  ask  or  intrigue  for  it,  but  neither  might  one
refuse  to  accept  it.  The  Priors  had  to  dwell  altogether
in  one  house,  where  they  lived  and  ate  in  common,  without
accepting  invitations  elsewhere  or  giving  private  audiences.^
The  next  subject  considered  was  the  election  of  the
new  magistrate,  namely,  the  Gonfalonier  of  Justice.  He
was  chosen  every  two  months  from  a  different  Sestiere
of  the  city,  and  his  electors  were  the  incoming  Priors,  cap-
tains, and  guild  masters,  with  the  addition  of  two  worthies
of  each  Sestiere.  He  was  elected  on  precisely  the  same
terms  as  the  Priors,  saving  that  he  might  return  to  office
after  one  year  instead  of  two  ;  he  lived  with  the  Priors
as  primus  inter  pares ;  he  received  the  same  honorarium
of  ten  soldi  per  day,  expenses  included,  so  that  he  was
practically  unremunerated.  But  having  higher  attributes
in  the  eyes  of  the  law,  he  became  speedily  and  of  neces-
sity the  chief  of  the  Signory.^  At  the  public  parliament
the  Gonfalon  of  the  People  was  solemnly  consigned  to
him,  and  one  hundred  pavesi,  or  shields,  and  twenty-five
cross-bows  with  bolts  were  placed  at  his  disposal,  for  the
better  equipment  of  part  of  the  thousand  popolani  yearly
selected  to  serve  under  him,  the  Podesta  and  Captain  to
preserve  order  and  enforce  the  execution  of  the  new  laws.3

'  Rubric  iii.,  G.  We  generally  quote  from  Giudici's  Italian  compila-
tion as  being  more  widely  known  than  the  others.  But  we  are  careful
to  collate  it  with  the  versions  of  Fineschi  and  Bonaini,  taking  note  of
significant  divergences.  The  letters  B.  G.  F.  are  used  to  indicate  the
respective  editions  of  Bonaini,  Giudici,  and  Fineschi.

^  Mons.  Perrens  (vol.  ii.  p.  385,  note  2)  doubts  this  fact,  and  states
that  it  only  occurred  in  1305.  It  is  certain  that  the  Gonfalonier's  function
was  to  enforce  the  enactments,  and  that  when  released  from  this  duty  by
the  creation  of  an  "  Executor "  in  1306,  he  then  began  to  be  more
specially  considered  as  the  chief  of  the  Signory ;  but  it  is  none  the  less
certain,  that  among  seven  magistrates,  all  of  the  same  legal  standing,
the  one  possessed  from  the  first  of  loftier  attributes  and  more  direct
command  of  the  army,  was  virtually,  if  not  nominally,  their  president
and  chief.

3  Rubric  iv.,  G.  and  F.  We  should  note  that  the  Latin  draft  reduces
the  Gonfalonier's  interval  of  ineligibility  to  one  year  only,  while    the  f


CLAUSES  TOUCHING  THE  NOBLES.  455

No  relation  of  the  Priors  in  office  could  be  elected  to  the
Gonfaloniership.  The  creation  of  this  new  post  certainly
serves  to  prove  that  the  necessity  of  giving  increased  unity
and  supremacy  to  the  Government  was  already  acknow-
ledged. But  at  that  period  Republican  jealousy  was  too
strong  to  sanction  anything  more  than  a  mere  show  of
supremacy.  Accordingly,  the  Gonfalonier  was  only  the
most  influential  of  the  Priors,  and  liable  to  be  changed  on
the  same  terms,  albeit  the  fact  of  having  the  free  dis-
posal, at  given  moments,  of  the  citizen  army  undoubtedly
endued  him  with  higher  authority.

In  treating  of  the  branch  of  the  enactments  bearing  on
social  rather  than  political  cases,  we  should  remark  first  of
all  that  to  these  enactments  was  owed  the  settled  constitu-
tion of  the  Florentine  guilds,  which  now  hastened  to  reframe
or  renew  their  own  special  statutes.  The  normal  number
of  the  guilds  was  likewise  established  by  the  enactments,
and  from  that  moment  remained  fixed  at  twenty-one.^  In
fact,  the  first  rubric  decreed  that  the  guilds  should  take  a

other  compilations  extend  it  to  two  years,  as  in  the  case  of  the  Priors
and  as  subsequently  enforced.  We  have  followed  the  Latin  draft,  for
the  additional  reason  that,  in  the  law  of  1293,  edited  by  Bonaini
(Doc.  A.  at  p.  74),  we  find  it  ordained  that  Priors  and  Gonfalonier
should  share  the  same  benefits  and  privileges,  "  salvo  et  excepto  quod
quae  in  Ordinamento  iustitie,  loquente  de  electione  Vexilliferi,  conti-
nentur  circa  devetum  et  tempus  deveti  ipsius  Vexilliferi,  et  circa  alia
omnia  in  ipso  ordinamento  descripta,  in  sua  permaneant  firmitate."
This  is  repeated  even  under  rubric  xxxi.,  G.  and  F.,  whence  we  are
forced  to  conclude  that  the  prescribed  interval  before  re-election  to  the
Gonfaloniership  was  originally  different  from  that  established  with
regard  to  the  Priorate,  and  only  equalised  with  the  latter  at  a  subsequent
time.  Besides,  in  Compilations  F.  and  G.  no  thought  was  given  to
correcting  the  rule  laid  down  in  rubric  xxxi.,  where  it  is  taken  for
granted  that  the  original  diversity  was  still  in  force.  Florentine  laws
were  always  made  and  amended  bit  by  bit.  All  doubts,  however,  are
solved  by  the  document  from  which  we  have  quoted,  dated  July  6,  1295,
extending  the  term  of  prohibition,  as  regarded  the  Gonfalonier,  from  one
to  two  years.     Salvemini  has  found  proofs  in  the  "  Provvisioni "  and

'  Consulte  "  that  this  rule  had  been  already  applied  in  December,  1294.

solemn  oath  to  maintain  union  and  concord  among  the
people.  The  second  rubric  annulled  and  forbade,  under
heavy  penalties,  all  companies^  leagues^  promises,  conventions,
obligations,  and  sworn  pacts,  that  is,  all  agreements  among
the  people  unprovided  or  unsanctioned  by  the  laws,  and
opposed  or  alien  to  the  constitution  of  the  guilds.  Both
procurators  and  stipulators  of  similar  agreements  were
liable  even  to  capital  punishment ;  and  any  guild  known
to  be  concerned  in  such  agreement  would  be  mulcted  in
one  thousand  lire;  the  consuls  of  the  said  guild,  and  the
notary  who  had  drawn  the  deed,  in  five  hundred  lire^
All  this  plainly  proves  that  the  law  was  not  devised,  as
once  believed  and  asserted,  for  the  sole  purpose  of  wreak-
ing vengeance  on  the  nobles,  but  was  also  framed  with
the  intent  of  reforming  the  city  and  government  by
solidly  organising  the  guilds  and  granting  them  higher
political  importance.  Nevertheless,  the  humiliation  of  the
leading  nobles  was  certainly  one  of  the  principal  objects  of
the  law.  Therefore  we  may  now  proceed  to  examine  the
clauses  directed  to  that  end.


VIII.

First  of  all,  to  punish  the  nobles  for  their  continual
attacks  on  the  people  it  was  requisite  to  make  them
guarantee  their  collective  responsibility,  since,  in  defiance
of  preceding  laws,  they  frequently  contrived  to  shirk  that
obligation.  Most  offences  being  punishable  by  fines,
persons  bound  by  no  guarantees  could  easily  evade  the  pre-
scribed penalty  on  some  pretext  or  another :  therefore  the
enactments  were  framed  to  prevent  such  evasion  of  justice. 2

'  Rubrics  i.  and  ii.  in  Compilations  B.,  F.,  and  G.

'  Rubrics  Ixiii.-lxv.,  which,  as  we  have  noted,  were  added  by  another
hand  in  1297,  to  the  codex  edited  by  Fineschi,  and  correspond  with
rubrics  Ixxxii.-lxxxiv.  of  the  codex  edited  by  Giudici,  there  is  renewed

REAL  SCOPE  OF  THE  ENACTMENT.  457

They  likewise  gave  fresh  force  to  old  laws  which  had  been
too  often  violated.  "  Further,  to  prevent  the  numerous
frauds  daily  committed  by  certain  leading  nobles  of  the  city
and  territory  of  Florence  with  regard  to  the  guarantees
pledged,  or  rather,  bound  to  be  pledged  by  the  said  nobles
according  to  the  terms  of  the  statute  of  the  Florentine
Commune,  as  decreed  under  the  rubric:  *De  la  securtadi
che  si  debbono  fare  da'  grandi  de  la  citta  di  Firenze,'  and
beginning  with  the  words  :  *  Accio  che  la  isfrenata  spezial-
mente  de'  grandi,'  &c. — it  is  provided  and  ordained,"  &c.i
Consequently,  all  the  nobles  already  enumerated  in  the
above-mentioned  statute,  and  of  whom  a  new  list  was  then
made,  were  ordered  to  give  guaranty,  from  the  age  of
fifteen  years  to  seventy,  without  exception,  by  the  pay-
ment of  two  thousand  lire^  a  sum  generally  sufficient  to
cover  the  highest  fines  exacted,  apart  from  confiscation,
which  penalty  was  not  only  commonly,  but  abusively
employed.  The  fact  of  being  enrolled  in  a  guild  did  not
suffice  to  exem.pt  any  of  these  nobles  from  the  duty
of  giving  guarantees ;  the  privilege  of  exemption  being
solely  granted  to  him  whose  entire  family,  for  this  or  that
reason,  even  by  special  indulgence,  had  been  spared  the
duty  of  giving  guarantees  for  five  years  at  least,  or  declared
absolutely  free  ^francata).  In  either  case  the  family  was
considered  to  be  thoroughly  of  the  people,  and  entitled  to
all  the  advantages  deriving  therefrom.     The  Signory  was

reference  to  the  tricks  employed  in  order  to  avoid  giving  guarantees
or  nullifying  tlieir  effect.  When  a  noble  committed  a  crime  and  refused
to  pay  the  prescribed  fine,  his  nearest  relation  was  legally  bound
to  pay  it  in  his  stead.  But  in  this  case  the  said  relation  frequently
made  declaration,  "  that  the  guilty  person  who  had  either  failed  to  give
guarantees  or  offered  pledges  unsuited  to  the  case,  possessed  one  or
more  legitimate  or  natural  children,  aged  one  year,  or  more  or  less ;  and
that  for  this  reason  the  next  of  kin,  or  those  supposed  to  be  responsible  in
virtue  of  the  said  enactment,  are  exempt  from  the  penalty  prescribed  by
the  same."     (Rubric  Ixxxii.,  G.,  Ixv.,  F.)

'  Rubric  xvii.,  G.    The  law  quoted  here  is  of  October  2,  1286  ("  Prov
visioni,"  i.  27).

empowered  to  reduce  the  sum  guaranteed  (//  sodamento)
in  the  case  of  the  poorer  nobles,  but  it  was  precisely  this
clause  that  opened  the  door  to  partiality  and  fraud. ^  The
law  proceeded  to  state  that  the  fixed  time  for  giving  guaran-
tees was  the  month  of  January  or  February  at  the  latest  :
any  one  refusing  or  delaying  obedience,  no  matter  in  what
way,  would  be  banished,  and  his  nearest  kin  in  the  male
line  compelled  to  give  surety  in  his  stead.  The  penalty  of
any  crime  committed  by  an  unguaranteed  person  was  to  fall
on  that  person's  relations.  But  when  the  penalty  was  death,
and  the  criminal  had  fled,  his  relations  must  pay  three
thousand  lire  instead  of  the  guaranteed  two  thousand.  But
in  case  of  mortal  feud  between  the  members  of  a  family
their  obligation  of  giving  surety  for  one  another  was  can-
celled. This  plainly  shows  that  when  community  of
interests  and  passions  had  ceased  to  exist  the  law  no  longer
insisted  on  the  collective  responsibility  of  kinsmen  or
associates.  This  assists  our  better  comprehension  of  the
real  scope  of  the  enactment.^

When,  however,  the  members  of  associations  acted
in  common,  as  one  entity,  the  law  framed  for  the
purpose  of  dissolving  those  associations  made  the  mem-
bers reciprocally  responsible,  obliging  them  to  guarantee
and  pay  for  one  another.  But  no  penalties  save  fines,
and  these  only  within  certain  limits,  were  exacted  from
relations  and  fellow  associates,  since  an  association  was
only    fined    as    a   collective    body.       This    will    explain

'  Rubric  xvii.,  B.,  F.,  G.  The  two  later  compilations  have  an  addition
tacked  on  at  the  end,  that  is  not  included  in  Compilation  B.  In  the
Italian  codex  (G.)  this  addition  is  undated,  but  in  the  Fineschi  compila-
tion is  dated  July  6,  1295.  Its  purpose  is  that  of  attenuating  the  law  by
declaring  that  all  omitted  from  the  list  of  nobles  in  the  statute,  or  who  have
changed  their  name,  and  are  known  by  another,  are  not  to  be  considered
nobles.  This  addition  was  contemporaneous  with  the  extension  of  the
legal  number  of  witnesses  from  two  to  three.

*  Rubrics  xviii.  and  xix.,  F.,  G.  These  and  rubric  xx.  also  are  not  in
the  Latin  draft,  as  we  shall  have  again  to  remark  farther  on.


THE  RIGOUR  OF  THE  LAW.  459

what  Compagni  and  Villani  meant  by  saying  that  accord-
ing to  the  enactments,  "  one  associate  was  bound  for  the
other."  I  We  may  see  how  Machiavelli  blundered,  or  at
least  exaggerated,  in  his  interpretation  of  their  words
when  he  stated  in  general  terms  that  "  the  associates  of  a
criminal  were  made  to  suffer  the  same  penalty  to  which
the  latter  was  condemned  ; "  2  and  we  can  also  note  the
mistake  committed  by  modern  writers  in  clinging  to  an
interpretation,  that  is  totally  contradicted  by  the  terms  of
the  enactments,  which  would  be  otherwise  in  opposition
to  the  culture  of  the  period  and  the  most  fundamental
principles  of  law.  The  measures  specially  directed  against
the  nobles  may  be  reduced  to  two  leading  clauses,  namely
the  revival  in  a  more  rigorous  shape  of  the  old  laws  exclud-
ing the  nobles  from  office  and  obliging  them  to  guarantee
and  pay  one  another's  fines  ;  and  the  increased  severity  of
the  punishments  inflicted  on  them  by — to  use  Villani's
words — "  a  different  mode  of  doubling  ordinary  penal-
ties." 3  Let  us  now  see  what  these  penalties  were  in  their
aggravated  form.

According  to  the  enactments,  should  a  noble  murder
or  procure  the  murder  of  one  of  the  people,  both  the
noble  and  the  doer  of  the  deed  are  to  be  condemned  to
death  by  the  Podesta,  and  their  property  destroyed  and
made  confiscate.4  Should  they  escape  by  flight,  they  are  to
be  sentenced  in  contumacy,  and  their  property  confiscated.
Nevertheless  their  guarantor  will  have  to  pay  the  sum  for
which  he  stood  surety,  but  with  right  of  reimbursement
from    the    confiscated    and    demolished    property  of  the

*  The  nobles  frequently  employed  friends  or  dependents  to  execute
their  deeds  of  vengeance  or  assault — hence  the  enactments  nearly  always
refer  to  authors  of  crime  in  the  plural  as  those  chiefly  charged  with  the
deed.  The  law  of  the  6th  of  July,  1295,  was  attenuated  on  this  point,
?>s  we  shall  see,  by  its  recognition  of  a  single  leader  or  "  captain  "  of  the
crime,  the  others  being  only  punished  as  accessories.


46o  THE  ENACTMENTS  OF  JUSTICE.

fugitive  criminal.  All  other  nobles  who,  without  being
direct  accomplices  in  the  crime,  have  had  any  share  in  it,
are  sentenced  to  a  fine  of  two  thousand  lire;  if  failing
to  pay  this,  their  property  is  confiscated,  and  their  kins-
men or  guarantors  bound  to  pay  it  in  their  stead.  But
when  the  crime  in  question  was  that  of  inflicting  serious
bodily  hurt,  the  doer  of  the  deed  and  its  instigators
were  sentenced  to  a  fine  of  two  thousand  lire.  If  refus-
ing to  pay  the  penalty,  their  hands  were  chopped  off;
if  escaping  the  reach  of  justice,  their  possessions  were
sacked,  their  funds  confiscated,  and  their  guarantors
bound  to  pay  the  fine,  but  with  the  usual  right  of  re-
imbursement from  the  sums  confiscated  by  the  State.
For  slighter  offences,  slighter  penalties  were  adjudged.
In  every  case  the  guilty  were  forbidden  to  hold  any
public  oflice  until  five  years  had  elapsed.  For  murderous
attempts,  the  sworn  testimony  of  the  injured  person  or
his  nearest  relation,  together  with  that  of  two  witnesses
to  the  public  voice  on  the  matter  {testimoni  di  pubblica
fama\  was  considered  sufficient  proof  of  the  crime  ;  nor
was  it  necessary  for  the  two  witnesses  to  have  seen  the
crime  actually  committed.  This  was  the  clause  most
obnoxious  to  the  nobles.  In  general  they  were  little
disturbed  by  threatened  punishment,  even  of  the  severest
kind,  since  they  always  hoped  to  escape  it.  But  they
were  roused  to  fury  as  well  as  alarm,  when  measures
were  taken  for  the  rigorous  enforcement  of  the  penalties
prescribed.  And  this  was  precisely  the  chief  intent  and
soul  of  the  enactments.  The  whole  course  of  procedure
enjoined  by  them  was  almost  as  summary  as  that  of
martial  law,  and  allowed  much  weight  to  public
opinion,  which,  in  the  midst  of  party  strife,  was  no
trustworthy  guide.  The  close  union  prevailing  in
associations  had  made  ordinary  legal  procedure  very
difiicult,  if  not  impossible.     Hence  it  was  ordained  that


PENALTIES  AND  FINES.  461

whenever  a  crime  was  perpetrated,  the  Podesta  was
bound  to  discover  its  author  within  five,  or  at  most
eight  days,  according  to  the  gravity  of  the  deed,  under
pain,  in  case  of  neglect  of  loss  of  office  and  a  fine  of  five
hundred  lire  for  minor  off"ences.  In  such  case,  however,
the  Captain  was  charged  to  take  the  matter  in  hand,  and
subject  to  the  same  penalties.  All  shops  were  then  to
be  closed,  the  artisans  called  to  arms,  and  the  Gonfalonier
to  be  on  the  alert  to  punish  all  recusants.  But  when  the
Podesta  discovered  the  criminal,  and  it  was  a  case  ot
homicide,  he  and  the  Gonfalonier  together  were  to  ring
the  tocsin  without  waiting  for  the  sentence  of  the  court,
and  assembling  the  thousand  select  men,  proceed  to
demolish  the  houses  belonging  to  the  criminal.  The
guild-masters  were  prompt  to  obey  the  Captain's
summons.  When  slighter  offences  were  in  question
the  criminal's  houses  were  not  destroyed  until  sentence
had  been  passed.^  It  should  be  remarked  that  this
pulling  down  of  houses  was  never  carried  to  the  point  of
total  demolition,  and,  particularly  in  cases  of  petty
crimes,  the  Gonfalonier  and  Podesta  always  settled  before-
hand what  damage  should  be  wrought.  2

Very  severe  penalties  were  imposed  both  on  injured
persons  failing  to  denounce  crime,3  and  on  the  makers  of
false  accusations.4  When  one  of  the  people  received
hurt  through  joining  in  some  quarrel  of  the  nobles,  or  in
cases  of  conflict  between  master  and  man,  the  enactments
were  not  applied,  and  the  common  law  was  again  enforced.5

■  This  is  derived  both  from  the  terms  of  the  enactments  and  from  the
chroniclers.  According  to  the  latter,  criminals  occasionally  obtained
partial  compensation  because  the  destruction  of  their  property  had  been
carried  too  far.  ^  Rubric  xii.,  F.  G.,  vii.,  B.

462  THE  ENACTMENTS  OF  JUSTICE.

Other  clauses  followed  touching  unjust  appropriation  of
the  people's  property  on  the  part  of  the  nobles,  and
obstacles  interposed  by  them  to  bar  the  former  from
due  receipt  of  income,  for  which  offences,  fines  varying
between  one  thousand  and  five  hundred  lire  were  pre-
scribed in  the  customary  wayJ  A  noble  sentenced  to
any  fine  was  forbidden  to  beg  or  collect  the  amount  from
others,  since  this  would  have  made  it  easier  to  commit
deeds  of  vengeance  in  common  and  pay  the  penalty  by
means  of  a  general  subscription.  Therefore  any  noble
begging  contributions  from  others  was  condemned  to  a
special  fine  of  five  hundred  lire;  while  all  trying  to
collect  money  for  him,  as  well  as  those  supplying  it,
were  mulcted   in  one  hundred  lire?


"  common  law  "  signified  Roman  law  ;  tlie  law  as  prescribed  by  the
statutes  being  held  almost  in  the  light  of  a  special  or  exceptional  code.
But  as  the  enactments  constituted  in  themselves  an  exception,  with
regard  to  the  statutes,  the  latter  are  referred  to  wherever  common  law  is
mentioned.  When  the  question  was  of  two  municipaUties,  one  of  which
was  subject  to  the  other,  the  subject  municipality  was  always  allowed
(excepting  in  political  concerns)  to  retain  its  own  statutes  ;  but  in  cases
where  these  proved  insufficient,  it  had  recourse  to  those  of  the  dominant
city,  as  though  these  constituted  the  common  law.

*  Rubric  ix.,  F.  G.,  and  vi.,  B.  In  this  case  two  witnesses  were  always
needed  to  prove  the  offence,  and  on  this  point  all  the  compilations,
including  the  rough  draft,  are  agreed.  Regarding  the  other  cases.
Compilation  B  (rubric  v.)  only  says  per  testes,  meaning  more  than  one,
that  is,  two  or  three.  On  the  6th  of  July,  1295,  ^er  testes  was  changed  to
per  ires  testes,  and  so  it  stands  also  in  rubric  vi.,  F.  and  G.

It  should  be  remarked  that  in  the  Italian  compilation  this  rubric  ix.
has  a  codicil  that  is  neither  comprised  in  the  draft  nor  even  in  Fineschi's
compilation,  and  this  is  an  additional  proof  that  the  Italian  compilation
was  of  later  date  than  the  Latin  text,  of  which  it  is  generally  the  faithful
translation.  The  codicil  decrees  that  the  fine  is  to  be  paid  to  the  Com-
mune either  by  the  offending  party  himself  or  his  nearest  relation.

Rubric  xi.,  F.  and  G.,  answering  to  rubric  xvi.,  B.,  treats  of  the  rights
acquired  by  nobles  over  real  propertv  appertaining  to  the  people,  and
alludes  in  this  connection  to  the  associates  or  relatives  of  the  popolani.
This  proves  that  the  custom  of  joining  in  associations  was  very  general
at  the  time,  and  likewise  shows  how  nearly  the  ties  of  association
resembled  ties  of  relationship.

MEASURES  PROPOSED  BY  GIANO  BELLA  BELLA.  463

No  appeal  of  any  sort  was  permitted  against  sentences
pronounced  according  to  the  enactments,''  since  these
overruled  all  ordinary  statutes,  and  it  was  forbidden  either
to  prorogue,  suspend,  or  alter  them,  under  penalty  of
incurring  the  severe  punishment  prescribed  in  the  General
Conclusion?'


IX.

Thus  the  Enactments  of  Justice  were  framed.  As
already  stated,  their  object  was  to  fortify  the  guilds,  give
greater  unity  to  the  Government  and  the  people,  humble
the  nobles,  and  promote  the  dispersal  of  associations.
Only  it  was  to  be  doubted  whether  a  law  of  this  kind
could  be  fully  carried  out,  or  would  not  rather  be  violated
by  the  nobles,  thus  sharing  the  fate  of  many  earlier  laws
promulgated  for  the  same  purpose.  Giano  della  Bella
used  his  best  efforts  to  avert  this  danger.  He  had  not
compiled  the  enactments,  nor  was  he  in  office  when  they
were  discussed  and  passed  ;  but  he  undoubtedly  assisted
in  promoting  them.  On  the  15th  of  February,  1293,
shortly  after  they  were  proclaimed,  he  was  elected  to  the
"  Priors,"  and  on  the  loth  of  April — namely,  ten  days
before  his  term  of  office  expired — we  find  that  a  new  law,
devised  for  the  purpose  of  "  fortifying  "  the  enactments
among  which  it  was  subsequently  incorporated,  was  pre-
sented, discussed,  and  passed  by  all  the  State  Councils.

'  Rubric  xxvi.,  G.,  xxi.,  B.

=  This  "  Conclusion  "  is  mutilated  in  the  xxii.  and  final  rubric  of  Com-
pilation B.     It  exists  in  full  in  rubric  xxvii.,  F.,  and  rubric  xxv.,  G.

It  should  be  noted  at  this  point  that,  leaving  aside  other  partial  dis-
parities, those  rubrics,  included  in  Compilations  G.  and  F.,  and  entirely
omitted  from  Compilation  B.  (whether  as  the  results  of  later  decrees,  or
actually  passed  at  the  time  when  the  draft  was  engrossed  in  its  definite
official  shape,  we  have  no  means  of  really  ascertaining),  were  those
indicated  in  Compilations  G.  and  F.  by  the  numbers  xviii.,  xix.,  and  xx.


464  THE  ENACTMENTS  OF  JUSTICE,

This  additional  law,  one  decidedly  accordant  with  the
spirit  of  action  rather  than  of  debate,  possessed  by  Giano
della  Bella,  was  of  a  very  simple  kind.  It  ordained  that
another  thousand  men,  together  with  one  hundred  and
fifty  magistri  de  lapide  et  lignamine  and  fifty  piconarii
fortes  et  robustly  cum  bonis  picconihus,}  should  be  added  to
the  force  of  one  thousand  popolani  at  the  disposition  of
the  Gonfalonier  of  Justice,  of  the  Captain  and  Podesta.
The  object  of  this  new  measure  was  self-evident  :  it  was
intended  to  inflict  real  punishment  ;  to  thoroughly  con-
fiscate the  property  and  demolish  the  abodes  of  all  nobles
doing  injury  to  the  people.  Accordingly  the  aristocrats
were  provoked  to  fury,  and  their  hatred  of  Giano  could
no  longer  be  restrained.  But  he  was  nowise  alarmed  ;
on  the  contrary,  it  spurred  him  to  new  efforts,  and  he
planned  another  measure,  that,  if  carried  into  effect,  would
have  proved  a  deathblow  to  the  nobles.

As  we  have  seen,  the  latter's  position  as  magistrates  of
the  Guelph  Society  still  kept  their  power  intact ;  so,  in
order  to  humble  them,  Giano  proposed  to  deprive  their
captains  "  of  the  Seal  of  the  Society,  and  of  its  property,
which  was  considerable,  and  hand  these  over  to  the
Commune.     Although  a  Guelph,  and  of  Guelph  nation-

'  This  law,  drawn  up  in  full  official  form,  is  contained  in  Document  A.
of  the  Bonaini  Compilation,  but  still  as  a  separate  law.  On  the  other
hand,  in  Compilations  F.  and  G.  we  find  it  incorporated  with  the  enact-
ments it  was  designed  to  strengthen.  In  Compilation  G.  it  is  dated
April  10,  1293,  so  also  in  the  Latin  Codex,  but  is  undated  in  Compilation
G.  We  should  remark  in  this  connection  that  the  law  edited  by  Bonaini
is  not  only  incorporated  with  the  enactments  in  Compilations  F.  and  G.,
but  in  both  comprises  codicils  of  a  later  date — such,  for  instance,  as
giving  power  to  call  nearly  the  whole  of  the  city  and  territory  to  arms,  up
to  the  number  of  12,200  men.  Had  this  clause  been  passed  in  Giano's
time,  the  chroniclers  could  not  have  failed  to  record  it.  Villani  states
that  at  first  one  thousand  men  only  were  enrolled — that  is,  the  same
number  authorised  by  the  earlier  enactments ;  the  number  was  after-
wards raised  to  two  thousand,  as  enjoined  by  the  new  law,  and  later  still
to  four  thousand  (viii.  i).  Therefore,  even  according  to  Villani,  the
number  was  progressively  enlarged.

ality,  he  hoped,  by  this  measure,  to  humble  the  power  of
the  magnates."  i  In  fact,  once  deprived  of  the  seal,  that
was  the  symbol,  as  it  were,  of  their  separate  entity  ;  once
their  movable  property,  or  funds,  transferred  to  the
Commune,  their  caste  would  have  been  notably  enfeebled,
if  not  destroyed,  and  the  last  stronghold  of  nobility  lost.
Giano's  proposal  was  likewise  justified  by  a  law  established
by  the  Guelph  Society,  decreeing  the  latter  to  be  only
entitled  to  one-third  of  the  property  confiscated  from  the
Ghibellines,  while  as  matter  of  fact  it  had  appropriated  the
whole.  Hence  there  was  some  reason  for  compelling  the
Society  to  disgorge  at  least  the  two-thirds  it  had  unduly
usurped.  To  what  extent  Giano's  plan  was  fulfilled,  the
absence  of  documents  leaves  us  in  ignorance.  Although
the  incident  is  recorded  by  historians,^  the  Guelph  Society
long  continued  to  exercise  tyrannous  rule.  At  any  rate
the  mere  fact  of  proposing  this  law  suffices  to  explain  the
increasing  hatred  developed  against  Giano,  and  the  speedily
visible  signs  of  approaching  disaster  in  the  city.

Thereupon  the  people  rose  to  the  emergency,  and
in  order  to  be  prepared  for  events,  hastened  to  avert
all  risk  of  foreign  war  by  concluding  peace  with  the
Pisans,  in  spite  of  the  latter  being  already  reduced  to
such  extremities,  that  the  continuation  of  the  war  would
have  certainly  led  to  their  still  deeper  humiliation  and
abasement.     But  the  Florentines    decided    for   peace   in

order  to  "  fortify  the  position  of  the  people,  and  lower
the  power  of  nobles  and  potentates,  who  often  acquire
renewed  strength  and  vitality  by  war."'

Negotiations  were  set  on  foot  during  the  Gonfalonier-
ship  of  Migliore  Guadagni  (April  15  to  June  15,  1293),
and  concluded  soon  afterwards  during  that  of  Dino  Com-
pagni.  The  terms  arranged  were  :  the  restitution  of
prisoners  ;  free  passage  through  Pisa  for  the  merchandise
of  all  communes  included  in  the  Tuscan  League,  and  the
same  right  of  passage,  free  of  duty,  for  Pisan  merchandise
through  the  States  of  the  League.  For  the  term  of  four
years  the  Pisans  were  to  contrive  the  election  of  their
Podesta  and  Captain,  in  such  wise  that  one  of  the  pair
should  always  belong  to  one  of  the  communes  of  the
League,  the  other  to  some  house  not  rebelled  against  the
same,  and  no  member  of  the  family  of  the  Counts  of
Montefeltro  was  ever  to  be  chosen.  Now  the  Pisan  leader
who  had  defended  the  city  so  valiantly,  and  filled  the
offices  of  Podesta,  Captain  of  the  people  and  of  war,  was
precisely  Count  Guido  Montefeltro.  Hence,  by  the
terms  of  the  treaty,  he  was  now  forced  to  leave  Pisa,
together  with  all  the  foreign  Ghibellines ;  and  twenty-five
leading  citizens  were  also  to  be  given  in  hostage.  Thus
the  Pisans  were  compelled  to  behave  with  the  harshest  ingra-
titude. The  count,  indeed,  might  have  made  them  pay
dearly  for  it,  being  still  in  command  of  a  numerous  and
most  devoted  army  ;  but  he  preferred  to  bear  the  insult
with  dignity.  Appearing  before  the  Council,  he  recounted
his  services  to  Pisa,  the  ill  return  made  for  them,  and
then,  having  received  the  monies  due  to  him,  instantly  p
went  away.  The  Pisans  were  likewise  pledged  to  dis-  ^o
mantle  the  walls  of  the  fortress  of  Pontedera,  and  to  fill
up  the  trenches  ;  farther,  to  recall  to  the  city  all  the  lead-

ing  Guelph  exiles.  On  the  other  hand,  Florence  was  to
give  back  their  castle  of  Monte-Cuccoli,  and  all  their
other  possessions  in  Val  d'Era.  ^

Having    thus  put    an  end    to    what   seemed    for    the
moment    their   wealthiest    concern,    the    Florentines    de-
voted  more  energy  to  the  less   important  undertakings
on  hand.     Various  districts  or  castles,  such  as  Poggibonsi,
Certaldo,  Gambassi,  and  Cutignano  were  reduced  to  sub-
mission.    The  Counts  Guidi  were  deprived  of  jurisdiction
over    numerous    domains    in    the    upper    valley    of    the
Arno.     Also  possession  was  resumed  of  many  others  in
the    Mugello,  which  had  been  illegally  usurped   by  the
said    Counts   Guidi,  the    Ubaldini,   and    other   powerful
lords.     A  commission  of   three    burghers   of  the   lower
class  was  then  appointed  to  estimate  all  possessions  ap-
pertaining   to  the    city  and   its  territory.     These    com-
missioners likewise  cleared  the  lands  of  the  St.  Eustachio
Hospital,  near  Florence,  of  many  unlawful  occupants,  and
put  the  estate  under  the  direct  protection  of  the  Consuls
of  the   Calimala  Guild.  2     Another  fact   should   also    be
noted,  if  only  to  prove  what  universal  energy  was  dis-
layed  at  this  juncture  by  the  Florentine  people  who,  as
JVillani  phrases  it,  "  were  heated  with   presumption  and
consciousness  of  power."     A  certain  man  fled  to  Prato
ifter    committing    some    crime,    and    was   given    refuge
:here.     The   Republic  immediately  demanded  his  extra-
]lition,  and  on  Prato's  refusal,  sentenced  the  Commune
o  a  fine  of  ten  thousand  lire  and  the  surrender  of  the
criminal,   despatching   a   single    messenger  with   a  letter
o  this   effect.     As  the  authorities   of  Prato    were   still
ecalcitrant,  war  was  promptly  declared,  horse  and  foot
ailed   to    arms,    and   the   town   was    finally    compelled

to  yield  the  point.     "And  this  is  how  the  hot-blooded
Florentines  managed  their  affairs."  ^

Just  when  all  was  safe  and  tranquil  outside  the  walls,
the  worst  of  dangers  began  in  the  city.  The  nobles  were
determined  to  prevent  the  Enactments  of  Justice  from
taking  effect,  and  accordingly  contrived  that  after  all
attacks  upon  the  people,  the  offenders  should  be  cited
before  judges  belonging  to  their  own  party.  These
conducted  the  trial  to  their  advantage,  and  thus  the
Podesta,  without  being  aware  of  it,  punished  the  innocent
instead  of  the  guilty.  For  the  nobles  sheltered  evildoers,
protected  their  fellow  associates,  and  on  every  attempt  to
enforce  the  law,  did  their  best  to  raise  riots.  All  these
proceedings  were  fiercely  combated  by  the  people,  under
the  guidance  of  Giano  della  Bella,  who  was  always  reiterating
the  cry,  "  Perish  the  city  rather  than  justice  !  "  Accord-
ingly public  feeling  became  so  inflamed  that  the  most
sanguinary  measures  were  threatened  in  retaliation  on  the
nobles.  The  first  family  to  incur  the  worst  penalties
decreed  by  the  enactments  were  the  Galli.  One  of  that
line  having  mortally  wounded  a  Florentine  merchant  in
France,  their  dwellings    in    Florence  were  demolished.  ^

'  Villani,  viii.  2  ;  and  "Cronica"  of  the  pseudo  B.  Latini,  ad  annum.

*  Ibid.  viii.  i.  Compagni  gives  a  different  version  in  vol.  i.  12.
He  relates  that  the  offenders  wrere  of  the  Galigai  family,  and  that  he,
being  Gonfalonier  at  the  time,  had  to  demolish  their  dwellings.  We
have  adhered  to  Villani,  who  states  the  fact  to  have  occurred  under
the  first  Gonfalonier,  Baldo  Ruffoli  (in  office  from  February  15th  to
April  15th),  whereas  Compagni  held  the  Gonfaloniership  from  June  15th
to  August  15,  1293,  ^i^d  it  is  scarcely  probable  this  could  have  been  }
the  first  occasion  on  which  the  enactments  were  enforced.  It  is
known  that  Compagni's  Chronicle  is  only  extant  in  copies  dated  after
his  time,  and  therefore  probably  containing  blunders,  alterations,  and


FRESH  ELEMENTS  OF  STRIFE  INTRODUCED.   469

This  instance  easily  prepared  the  way  for  sterner  measures.
The  people  clamoured  for  new  and  more  vigorous  sen-
tences ;  therefore  it  was  feared,  says  Compagni,  "  that
were  the  accused  left  unpunished,  the  rector  would  be
left  to  bear  the  brunt,  and  thus  no  accused  person  was
granted  impunity."  The  fury  of  the  nobles  reached
its  climax,  and  they  complained,  with  some  show  of
reason,  that  "  if  a  horse  at  full  gallop  chanced  to  whisk
its  tail  in  the  face  of  a  popolano^  or  some  one  in  a  crowd
pushed  against  another  man's  breast,  or  small  children
came  to  blows,  there  was  no  reason  why  their  property
should  be  ruined  on  such  slender  pretext."  ^

Accordingly  they  conceived  the  idea  of  conspiring  to
the  bodily  hurt  of  Giano,  the  ringleader  and  head  of  the
people,  and  thus  getting  rid  of  him  for  ever.  To
compass  his  assassination  seemed  easy,  by  reason  of  his
straightforward  impetuosity  and  incautiousness.  He
had  great  influence  over  the  populace,  but  even  this
was  a  point  open  to  attack.  As  we  have  seen,  the  Lesser
Guilds  and  the  populace  lived  by  petty  industry  and  small
trades  carried  on  within  the  city  ;  and  their  chief  profits
being  derived  from  noble  customers,  the  latter  had  much
ascendancy  over  them  and  no  few  adherents  in  their
ranks.     Besides  this,  a  certain    amount  of  jealousy  had

additions  made  by  its  transcribers.  Compagni' s  chronology  is  often
extremely  vague.  While  Gonfalonier  he  may  have  undoubtedly  seen
some  sentences  executed  ;  but  the  first  sentence  on  the  nobles  seems
to  have  been  carried  out  as  related  by  Villani,  and  also  corroborated
by  Coppo  Stefani,  bk.  iii.,  rubric  198,  Ammirato,  vol.  i.  p.  338,
and  other  historians  of  weight.  Some  years  after  the  first  publica-
tion of  this  essay,  Professor  Scheffer  Boichorst  produced  the  famous
work  {vide  "  Historische  Zeitschrift,"  xxiv.  p.  313,  1870)  that  raised  the
very  heated  controversy  as  to  the  authenticity  of  Dino  Compagni's
Chronicle.  At  a  later  period  Professor  Del  Lungo's  learned  volumes
induced  the  German  scholar  to  cede  many  of  the  points  in  dispute.
Accordingly  we  may  still  continue  to  refer  to  Dino  Compagni,  although
not  without  careful  sifting  and  discrimination.

470  THE  ENACTMENTS  OF  JUSTICE.

already  sprung  up  between  the  lowest  class  and  the
well-to-do  burghers,  who,  being  mainly  concerned  in  the
export  and  import  trade,^  were  independent  of  the  nobles,
hated  them,  and  sought  their  destruction.  Nevertheless
these  burghers  could  not  approve  of  Giano's  attempts  to
rouse  the  ambition  and  increase  the  strength  of  the  lowest
class,  which  was  disgusted  at  being  excluded  from  the
Government  and  yearning  to  have  a  share  in  it.

Another  element  of  strife  was  soon  to  be  introduced  by
the  election  of  Pope  Boniface  VIII.  (December,  1294).
This  Pontiff  had  an  immoderate  appetite  for  temporal
power,  and  believed  that  owing  to  the  interregnum  of
the  Empire,  its  rights  could  now  be  assumed  by  the
Papacy  throughout  Italy  and  Europe.  He  was  particu-
larly anxious  to  increase  his  power  in  Florence,  the
leading  city  of  Tuscany,  where  his  own  predecessors
had  appointed  Charles  of  Anjou  to  the  post  of  imperial
vicar.  Therefore  he  quickly  began  to  open  negotiations
with  the  nobles,  whose  present  weakness  increased  their
readiness  to  come  to  terms  with  him,  and  who  would
have  willingly  resumed  the  government  of  the  city  in
his  name,  just  as  their  Ghibelline  ancestors  had  often
held  it  in  the  name  of  the  emperor.  But  this  was
naturally  opposed  by  the  burghers,  who  being  determined,
on  the  contrary,  to  maintain  the  liberty  and  independence
of  the  Republic,  could  not,  albeit  staunch  Guelphs,  side
with  the  Pope  at  that  moment.

Secret  intrigues  between  Boniface  and  the  nobles  were
now  carried  on  through  the  Spini,  rich  Florentine  mer-
chants, who,  as  bankers  to  the  Curia,  had  agents  in  Rome.
The  first  step  hazarded  was  to  call  to  Tuscany  a  certain
Giovanni  di  Celona,^  who  was  already  on  the  march
towards  Italy  with  several  hundred  men,  in  response  to
a  summons  from  the  Pope  and  the  nobles.     The  latter,

PLOT  AGAINST  GIANO  DELLA  BELLA.        471

intending  to  use  his  force  for  their  own  ends,  had  made
him  many  promises,  and  with  the  concurrence,  it  would
seem,  of  certain  of  the  burghers.  But  the  affair  dragged,
and  men's  passions  were  now  outstripping  the  political
manoeuvres  employed  to  feed  the  flame.  Accordingly,
without  further  delay,  it  was  decided  to  hatch  a  scheme
for  the  murder  of  Giano  della  Bella.  "The  shepherd
struck  down,  his  flock  will  be  scattered,"  so  said  the
nobles.

Only,  as  it  fell  out,  the  party  in  favour  of  craft  pre-
vailed over  the  side  preferring  violence.  At  this  moment
frequent  excesses,  perpetrated  by  the  people,  remained
unpunished  through  the  pusillanimity  of  the  judges.
The  butchers  in  particular,  led  by  one  Pecora,  an
audacious  ruffian,  who  had  publicly  threatened  the
Signory,  committed  worse  outrages  from  day  to  day.
Hence,  at  the  popular  meetings  frequently  held  by  Giano,
the  nobles,  knowing  his  love  of  justice,  would  whet  his
indignation  by  saying,  "Dost  not  see  the  violence  of
the  butchers .?  Dost  not  see  the  insolence  of  the  judges,
who,  by  threatening  to  punish  the  rectors  when  the  time
of  investigation  arrives,i  wrest  unjust  favours  from  them  }
Suits  are  suspended  for  three  or  four  years,  and  sentences
never  pronounced."  Thereupon  the  loyal  Giano  would
promptly  reply,  "  May  the  city  perish,  rather  than  this
state  of  things  be  continued !  Let  laws  be  framed  to
repress  all  this  wickedness."  And  then  the  nobles  would
maliciously  hasten  to  inform  judges  and  butchers  that
Giano  meant  to  crush  them  with  new  laws.2  In  pursuance
of  this  cunning  scheme,  they  suggested  a  law  against
exiles,  in  the  hope  of  soon  being  able  to  apply  it  to  Giano
himself.     It  seems  that  he  was  on    the  point  of  falUng

into  the  trap,  but  received  timely  warning.  So  then,
refusing  to  hear  another  word,  either  from  friends  or  foes,
he  forbade  that  any  law  whatever  should  be  proposed,
and  threatened  his  enemies  with  death.  Accordingly  the
meeting  only  served  to  increase  the  general  heat  and
ferment.^

The  nobles  were  not  to  be  checked  so  easily.  Seeing
that  Giano  still  retained  many  friends,  and  that  there  was
no  hope  of  conquering  by  craft,  they  held  a  private
sitting  in  the  church  of  San  Jacopo  Oltrarno,  to  discuss
what  should  be  done  ;  and  violent  measures  were  once
more  suggested.  Giano's  personal  enemy,  Betto  Fresco-
baldi,  the  same  who  had  once  struck  him  in  the  face  at
San  Piero  Scheraggio,  spoke  to  this  effect  :  *'  Let  us  cast
off  this  slavery  ;  let  us  arm  and  rush  to  the  Piazza  ;  let
us  kill  both  friends  and  enemies  of  the  popular  class,  as
many  as  we  find  of  them,  so  that  neither  ourselves  nor
our  sons  may  ever  be  crushed  by  them."  But  the
promoters  of  intrigue  were  again  in  opposition,  and  Baldo
della  Tosa  replied  very  quietly,  "  The  wise  knight's
counsel  is  good,  but  too  risky,  since,  should  the  scheme
fail,  we  should  all  perish.  First  let  us  conquer  (our
enemies)  by  cunning,  and  excommunicate  them  with  soft
words.  .  .  .  And  when  thus  excommunicated,  let  us  harry
them  in  such  sort  that  they  can  never  lift  their  heads
again."  2

But  quite  suddenly  a  fitting  opportunity  for  violence
spontaneously  arose.  Corso  Donati,  one  of  the  most
powerful  and  arrogant  of  Florentines,  induced  some  of  his

meetings  in  which  nobles  and  people  were  brought  together.  They  may
have  been  private  or  preliminary  assemblies.  But  even  at  the  Councils  of
the  Guelph  Society,  as  also  at  those  of  the  Podesta,  nobles  and  people  sat
together,  and  therefore  had  continual  opportunities  for  talking  over
affairs  of  the  State  and  discussing  proposed  bills.

followers  to  assault  Messer  Simone  Galastroni,  and  a  riot
ensued  in  which  one  man  was  killed  and  two  wounded.
Both  sides  laid  complaints ;  but  when  the  affair  was
brought  before  the  judges  charged  to  try  the  case,  one
of  them,  influenced  by  the  usual  party  spirit,  arranged
that  the  notary  should  reverse  the  depositions  of  the
witnesses.  When  the  case,  thus  garbled,  was  brought
before  the  Podesta,  Giano  di  Lucino,  he  acquitted  Donati,
and  condemned  Galastroni.  Thereupon  the  people  who
had  witnessed  the  riot,  and  knew  all  the  circumstances,
rose  to  arms,  shouting  through  the  streets  :  "  Perish  the
Podesta  ;  he  shall  perish  by  fire  !  "  They  made  for  the
palace,  faggots  in  hand,  to  burn  down  the  door,  and
expecting  to  be  actively  assisted  by  Giano  della  Bella.
But,  on  the  contrary,  he  sided  with  the  magistrates,
whose  authority  he  invariably  held  in  respect.  Neverthe-
less, the  door  of  the  Podesta's  palace  was  consumed,  his
horses  and  chattels  were  stolen,  his  men  captured,  and
his  papers  scattered  and  torn.  And  as  many  persons
knew  him  to  possess  indictments  against  them,  they  took
care  to  destroy  his  official  documents.  He  and  his  wife
contrived  to  escape  to  an  adjoining  house,  and  obtained
refuge  there.  Corso  Donati,  who  was  in  the  palace  at
the  time,  saved  his  life  by  flying  from  roof  to  roof

The  Councils  assembled  the  next  day,  and  for  the
honour  of  the  Republic  decided  to  restore  all  the
Podesta's  stolen  property  to  pay  him  his  salary  and  send
him  away.  Thus  order  was  re-established  at  once,  but
public  feeling  was  still  very  inflamed,  and  the  nobles  saw
that  the  moment  for  wreaking  vengeance  on  Giano  had
finally  arrived.  In  fact,  some  of  the  people  were  his  foes,
owing  to  the  numerous  calumnies  purposely  launched
against  him,  and  among  others  the  charge  of  having
promoted  decrees  to  the  hurt  of  the  judges  and  butchers  ;
some,  again,  were  furious  because  he  had  sided  with  the

Podesta,  while  others  denounced  him  as  the  author  of  the
riot.  Accordingly,  profiting  by  the  general  confusion
and  uncertainty,  his  enemies  succeeded  in  obtaining  the
premature  election  of  a  Signory  opposed  to  his  views  ;
and  he  was  speedily  cited  before  the  new  magistrates  on
the  charge  of  having  caused  the  disturbance.  At  this
the  whole  city  rose  in  tumult.  Some  desired  his  con-
demnation ;  but  the  populace  hastened  to  assume  his
defence.  Thereupon  he  decided  to  go  away,  and  left
Florence  on  the  5th  of  March,  1295,  for  he  shrank  from
being  the  cause  of  civil  strife,  hoped  that  his  departure
would  open  the  eyes  of  the  wiser  citizens,  and  that  the
latter  would  speedily  procure  his  recall.  However,  in
this  his  calculations  were  at  fault,  for  he  had  many  more
enemies  than  he  imagined.  Accordingly  he  was  sentenced
in  contumacy  in  the  name  of  the  enactments  he  had
urged,  and  of  which  he  was  held  to  be  the  author.  The
Pope  hastened  to  congratulate  the  Florentines,  and  Giano
realised  that  his  star  had  set.  So,  acting  with  his  usual
impetuosity,  he  unhesitatingly  removed  to  France,  where
he  possessed  some  share  in  the  Pazzi  bank,  and  died
there  in  exile.  His  Florentine  houses  were  demolished,
his  friends  and  relations  condemned  to  punishment,  but
the  Enactments  of  Justice  long  remained  in  force.  ^  With
regard  to  Giano,  Villani  remarks  that  "  every  one  who
became  a  leader  of  the  people  or  the  masses  in  Florence
was  invariably  deserted."  He  adds  that  "  on  account  of
this  novelty,  there  was  great  perturbation  and  change  in
the  people  and  city  of  Florence,  and  that  henceforth  the
artisans  and  populace  had  little  power  over  the  Commune ;


•  We  have  gleaned  this  narrative  from  Villani  and  Compagni,  en-
deavouring to  make  their  accounts  agree,  although  this  is  no  easy  task,
seeing  that  the  two  are  at  odds  on  many  points.  Accordingly  v^q  have

diction.    Compagni,  i.  16,  17  ;  Villani,  viii.  8.

powerful  burghers."  ^

XII.

These  concluding  words  from  the  chronicle  of  a  skilled
observer  such  as  Villani  enable  us  to  understand  more  com-
pletely the  general  character  of  the  revolution  described  ;
for  as  this  was  the  natural  outcome  of  many  preceding
disturbances,  its  study  throws  a  new  light  on  earlier  events.

When  the  Florentines  succeeded  in  destroying  the
castles  of  feudal  and  Ghibelline  nobles  scattered  over  their
territory,  and  in  forcing  the  conquered  to  inhabit  the
city,  the  Republic  became  split,  as  we  have  seen,  in  two
parties,  constantly  at  strife  :  the  one  composed  of  Ghibel-
line lords,  the  other  of  Guelph  popolani.  When  the
HohenstaufFens  of  Naples  and  Palermo  called  all  the
Ghibellines  of  Italy  to  arms,  the  magnates  of  the  party
took  the  lead  in  Tuscany,  with  Frederic  and  Manfred  to
back  them,  again  dominated  Florence  and  drove  out  the
Guelphs.  But  when  the  Swabians  fell  and  were  replaced
by  the  House  of  Anjou,  the  Empire  became  weakened,
and  Italian  policy  took  a  new  turn.  The  Guelphs  once
more  triumphed  in  Florence,  and  the  democratic  element,
already  constituting  the  real  strength  of  the  State,  wreaked
vengeance  on  the  Ghibellines,  who  seemed  to  be  almost
annihilated.  Only  as  it  chanced,  at  this  moment,  the
Guelphs  were  split  into  two  factions,  the  nobles  on  one
side,  the  people  on  the  other  ;  and  this  division  led  to
another  and  equally  bitter  struggle,  undertaken  for  the
purpose  of  crushing  the  magnates  outright.  Thus  the
latter  were  driven  to  crave  admission  to  the  guilds,  to
assume  democratic  habits,  and  even  to  discard  their  old

476  THE  ENACTMENTS  OF  JUSTICE,

family  names,  unless  resigned  to  exclusion  from  the
government.  After  a  prolonged  series  of  different  legal
measures  and  revolutions,  the  Enactments  of  Justice  finally
achieved  the  aim  that  the  Florentine  Republic  had  so  long

and,  indeed,  from  its  birth — kept  in  view,  namely,  the

triumph  of  democracy.

But  the  Republic  comprised  the  populace  as  well  as  the
people  ;  and  although  both  orders  were  united  in  fighting
the  nobles,  they  split  apart  as  soon  as  their  common  vic-
tory was  assured.     Thus  the  party  of  the  rich  burghers,
or  Greater  Guilds,  gradually  sprang  into  being.     At  first
there  were  twelve  of  these  guilds,  and  they  seemed  to  be
at  one  with  the  nine  Lesser  Trades,  afterwards  increased  to
fourteen  ;  but,  as  time  went  on,  these  fell  more  widely
apart   from    the   remaining    seven,  and    strictly  Greater,
Guilds,  and  began   to  struggle   against  them,  thus  con-
stituting the  party  of  the  rich  burghers  or  p-polo  grasso.
The  formation  and  successful  career  of  this  party,  so  long
at  the  head  of  the  Government,  dates,  as  Villani  tells
us,  from  the  defeat  of  Giano  della  Bella,  whose  down-
fall was  caused  by  the  temporary  alliance  of  the  nobles
and    the    more    powerful   section    of    the    people.     The
latter  soon  divided  both  from  the  nobles  and  lower  class,
was  equally  victorious  over  either  party,  and  constituted
one  of  the  most  energetic,  sharp-witted,  and  intelligent
democracies  of  which  history  has  record.     It  comprised
the  richest  and  most  vigorous  section  of  the  people,  known
for  that  reason  as  the  pplo  grasso,  and  gradually  became
master  of  the  city.     And  albeit  this  state  of  things  was  a
natural  result  of  past  revolutions,  it  was  undoubtedly  pre-
cipitated by  the  Enactments  of  Justice.       These  had  been
promoted  by  Giano,  with  the  aid   of  the   people,  to   be
used  as  a  weapon  against  the  nobles.     He  fell  a  victim  to
the  latter,  when  they  hoodwinked  the  people  by  feigning
to   unite  with   them   for   the   nonce.     It   was   certainly


::.:s:.j:,.^.«.:«fc.,,,-

INCREASING  POWER  OF  FIORENCE.  477

altogether  against  his  own  will  that  Giano  helped  to  pro-
mote  the  formation  of  a  party,  that,  issuing  from  the
wreck  of  the  nobles  and  populace,  finally  excluded  both
alike  from  all  participation  in  the  government  of  Florence.
For  a  long  time,  at  any  rate,  this  party  raised  the  power
of  the  Republic  to  a  very  lofty  height,  and  directed  its
policy  for  more  than  a  century.     The  moment  of  its  con-
solidation coincided  with  that  in  which  Florence  became
the   seat   of  Italian   culture,  and    hence    of  the    general
culture  of  Europe.     Nor  is  there  any  cause  to   be  sur-
prised by  the  vast  intellectual,  political,  and  moral  success
of  the  commercial  democracy  of  Florence.    In  the  days  of
the    Hohenstauffen,  the    Italian    aristocracy  undoubtedly
constituted  the  most  cultivated  and  civilised  part  of  the
nation  ;    all   great    political    questions,    and    the    great
struggles  between  the  Papacy  and  the  Empire,  in  which
the  whole  of  Europe   took  so  lively  a  share,  were  alike
carried  on  by  that  class.     The  Court  of  Frederic  II.  had
been  the  headquarters   of  those   contests,  and  the   most
dazzling  centre  of  mental  light  in  the  world  at  the  time.
The  language  spoken  there  was  the  language  of  courtiers ;
the  Court  was  sceptical,  and  the  first  poets  were  princes
or  barons.     The   Emperor  Frederic,  his  son  Enzo,  and
his  secretary.  Pier   della  Vigna,  gave  voice   to  the  first
notes  of  the  Italian  muse.    It  was  a  privileged  and  limited
order,  in  which  literature   and  science  still  retained  the
characteristics  of  chivalry  and  scholasticism.     In  imitation
of  their  French  and  Provencal  masters,  these  poets  lauded
some  imaginary  woman  or  some  fantastic  and  unreal  love  in
obstinately  artificial  verse.     They  were  never  able  to  cast
off  mediaeval  and  conventional  forms.     At  the  same  time,
however,  the  merchants  and  working  men  of  our  republics,
more    especially  of  Florence,  were   scouring    the  world,
founding  banks  and  business  firms  throughout  the  East
and  the  West ;  they  were  studying  jurisprudence,  always


478  THE  ENACTMENTS  OF  JUSTICE.

and  everywhere  demonstrating  a  special  aptitude  for
framing  laws,  creating  new  institutions,  and  directing  vast
concerns.  By  this  means  they  acquired  that  practical
knowledge  of  mankind  and  the  universe,  that  sense  of  truth
and  reality,  so  entirely  absent  from  pre-existent  literatures,
and  precisely  required  to  originate  the  first  literature  of
the  modern  world.

Naturally,  however,  those  merchants,  solely  versed  in
commerce  and  petty  local  politics,  lacked  the  breadth  and
loftiness  of  thought,  the  mental  culture  and  refinement
needed  to  solve  the  hard  problem  without  help.  At  the
same  moment,  Florence,  the  most  active  and  intelligent
of  Italian  republics,  was  enduring  the  series  of  great
and  radical  changes,  already  described,  which  after  much
sanguinary  strife  and  a  new  rearrangement  of  social  condi-
tions, suddenly  raised  her  to  a  truly  fortunate  position.
Owing  to  her  successes  in  war,  Florence  now  commanded
every  highway  of  commerce,  and,  by  the  amazingly  rapid
extension  of  her  trade,  was  enabled  to  acquire  mighty  and
no  longer  contested  preponderance  in  Tuscany  and  become
its  chief  as  well  as  its  central  city.  The  actual  antagonism
between  the  Pope  and  the  Angevins,  together  with  the
altered  conditions  of  the  Empire,  enabled  her  to  steer
cautiously  between  those  rival  powers  and  assume  for  the
first  time  great  and  genuine  political  importance  in  Italy.
Thus  the  extent  of  her  concerns  and  the  circle  of  her  ideas
were  simultaneously  enlarged.  The  two  most  intelligent
and  most  hostile  classes  of  her  citizens,  namely,  the  now
powerful  traders  and  the  nobles  now  reduced  to  equality
with  them,  became  transformed  and  definitely  fused  in  one
class  during  the  course  of  their  fierce  conflict,  excluding,  on
the  one  hand,  the  lowest  order  of  the  people,  and  on  the
other,  those  of  the  nobles  who,  whether  aspiring  to  absolute
rule  or  obstinately  clinging  to  feudal  customs  and  the
authority  of  the  Empire,  remained  blindly  opposed  to


TRIUMPHS  OF  ART  AND  INTELLECT.         479

municipal  institutions  which  were  nevertheless  predestined
to  triumph.  Need  we  then  feel  surprised  if  at  this  moment
art  and  literature  put  forth  their  fairest  blossoms,  and  in  the
life-giving  air  of  freedom  were  seen  to  expand  their  leaves
and  shed  their  fragrance  through  the  world  ?  It  is  enough
to  read  the  records  and  glance  at  the  laws  of  the  Republic
in  order  to  discern  that  in  the  closing  years  of  the  fourteenth
century  a  new  spirit  was  stirring  the  people  and  a  new  sun,
as  it  were,  rising  in  the  sky.

Every  page  of  the  chronicles  records  the  undertaking  of
very  important  public  works,  the  erection  of  city  squares,
canals,  bridges,  and  walls.  And  simultaneously  with  these,
the  most  enduring  monuments  of  modern  art  were  spring-
ing up  from  the  ground.  During  the  same  period  Arnolfo
di  Cambio  worked  on  the  Baptistery,  began  the  church  of
Santa  Croce,  and,  according  to  the  chroniclers,  received
from  the  Signory  a  solemnly  worded  order  to  reconstruct
the  old  cathedral  from  the  foundations  by  erecting  a  new
one  "  of  the  most  magnificent  design  the  mind  of  man
could  conceive,  rendering  it  worthy  of  a  heart  expanded  to
much  greatness  by  the  union  of  many  spirits  in  one."  *
Undoubtedly  it  was  then  that  Arnolfo  laid  the  first  stone
of  the  fane  considered  by  many  the  finest  church  in  the
world.  At  the  same  time  a  great  number  of  monumental
buildings  and  public  works  were  being  also  carried  on  :
Santo  Spirito,  for  instance,  Orsammichele,  and  Santa  Maria
Novella.  In  1299  Arnolfo  likewise  began  the  Palace  of
the  Signoria,  another  marvel  of  modern  architecture,  that
seems  to  be  so  thoroughly  in  character  with  the  Republic
and  expressive  of  the  youthful  vigour  then  animating  the
Florentine  people.  In  the  same  year  the  construction  of  new

'  This  famed  decree,  quoted  in  Del  Migliore's  "  Firenze  Illustrata "
(Florence,  Ricci,  1821),  vol.  i.  p.  6,  and  repeated  by  numerous  writers,  is
certainly  a  very  beautiful  one  ;  but  the  original  document  of  it  has  never
been  discovered,  and  the  form  in  which  it  has  come  down  to  us  leads  to
the  belief  that  some  changes  at  least  must  have  been  made  in  it  by  a
modern  hand.


48o  THE  ENACTMENTS  OF  JUSTICE.

walls,  suspended  since  1285,  was  also  resumed.  And  while
churches,  public  buildings,  and  private  palaces  were  rising
on  all  sides,  Giotto's  brush  was  employed  to  cover  their
walls  with  a  lavish  profusion  of  lofty  and  immortal  compo-
sitions ;  sculpture  rivalled  painting  in  decorating  temples
with  imperishable  works,  and  gave  birth  to  the  Tuscan
school  that  was  afterwards  to  culminate  in  Donatello,
Ghiberti,  the  Delia  Robbia,  and  Michelangelo.  What,
too,  are  the  names  most  frequently  occurring  in  the  records
of  those  times,  and  amid  the  struggles  promoting  or
following  the  Enactments  of  Justice .?  At  every  turn,
among  the  Priors,  the  Gonfaloniers,  and  ambassadors,  or  at
hot  debates  in  council,  we  meet  with  Dante  Alighieri,  Bru-
netto  Latini,  Giovanni  Villani,  Dino  Compagni,  and  Guido
Cavalcanti,  the  creators  of  Italian  poetry  and  prose.  The
Divine  Comedy  bristles  with  continual  allusions  to  the
events,  amid  which  it  was  conceived,  and  which  all  seem  to
be  informed  by  the  same  spirit,  since,  even  in  a  thousand
varying  garbs,  it  always  asserts  its  identity.  Therefore
the  Enactments  of  Justice  are  neither  the  work  of  a  single
individual,  nor  suddenly  improvised  by  Giano  della  Bella,
but  rather  the  outcome  of  many  revolutions  :  a  body  of
statutes  proving  and  explaining  the  definite  form  and
character  of  the  Florentine  Republic.  The  same  character,
albeit  less  splendidly  displayed,  appertained  in  varying
degree  to  the  other  Italian  communes.  But  of  them  all
Florence  was  ever  the  most  original  and  brilliant  example.


NOTE   TO   CHAPTER  VIII.


At  this  point  it  is  necessary  to  allude  to  a  question  that  has  recently
arisen  concerning  the  Enactments  of  Justice.  Signor  Salvioli  and
Prof.  Pertile,  when  describing  certain  Bolognese  statutes  of  1271
for  keeping  the  nobles  in  check,  took  it  for  granted  that  the  Floren-


I


DOCUMENT.  481

tine  enactments  of  1293  had  been  copied  from  those.  But  the
Bolognese  statutes  of  1271  having  never  been  unearthed,  the  hypo-
thesis met  with  little  favour.  When  Prof.  Gaudenzi  edited  the
"  Ordinamenta  sacrata  et  sacratissima "  of  Bologna  in  1282-84
(Bologna,  the  Merlani  Press,  1888),  he  noted  their  marked  resem-
blance to  the  Enactments  of  Justice  of  1293,  and  considered  it  to
be  beyond  a  doubt  that  the  latter  had  been  derived  from  the  former.
Indeed,  he  went  to  the  point  of  asserting  as  a  fact  "  Che  in  genere
i  rivolgimenti  e  gli  ordini  di  Firenze  non  furono  che  I'imitazione  di
quelli  di  Bologna"  (Preface,  p.  v.).

The  decided  injustice  of  this  last  assertion  has  been  already  pointed
out  by  Dr.  Hartwig,  in  his  recent  precious  work  on  Florentine  history
("  Ein  Menschenalter  Florentinische  Geschichte,  1250-1293"  (Frei-
burg, 1889-91),  extracted  from  vols,  i.,  ii.,  and  v.  of  the  "Deutsche
Zeitschrift  fiir  Geschichtwissenschaft").  For  in  truth  Florentine  laws
and  institutions  issue  very  directly  from  the  history  of  Florentine
society  and  Florentine  revolutions,  which  are  very  different  from  those
of  Bologna.

As  to  the  other  question,  that  is,  whether  the  Florentine  enact-
ments, of  1293  were  really  derived  from  the  Bologna  statutes  of  1282,
I  feel  considerable  doubt,  and  believe  that  no  definite  solution  can
be  reached  until  fresh  researches  in  the  Florence  Archives  have  corro-
borated the  result  of  Prof  Gaudenzi's  studies  of  Bolognese  docu-
ments. Meanwhile  I  need  merely  remark  —  That  the  people's
struggles  with  the  magnates,  and  the  harsh  and  often  cruel  laws  promul-
gated against  them,  were  not  exclusively  confined  to  Florence,  but
incidents  of  very  common  occurrence  in  the  history  of  our  communes.
Notwithstanding  many  points  of  general  resemblance,  these  conflicts
and  laws  varied  very  much  in  difi^erent  communes.  Hence,  in  order
to  prove  to  what  extent  the  Bolognese  enactments  served  as  models
for  those  of  Florence,  it  is  not  enough  to  compare  the  two  codes  and
note  their  respective  dates.  As  plainly  proved  by  the  events  we  have
related,  and  additionally  confirmed  by  all  the  later  researches  of
Hartwig,  Del  Lungo,  and  Perrens,  the  Florentine  ordinances  are  found
to  be  a  synthesis  of  other  and  much  earlier  laws  against  the  nobles,
and  sometimes  literal  reproductions  of  them.  The  enactments  them-
selves quote  a  law  of  1286  frequently  mentioned  by  historians,  and,  as
we  have  seen,  even  the  "Consulte"  of  1 282  refer  to  an  earlier  law  against
the  nobles.  These  anterior  laws  are  the  veritable  source  of  the
Florentine  enactments,  which,  however,  are  not  solely  designed,  like
the  Bolognese  ordinances,  for  the  repression  of  the  nobles,  but  to
promote  the  transfer  of  the  government  to  the  Greater  Guilds,  a  change
already  inaugurated  in  Florence  as  far  back  as  1250.     It  is  this  double

32


482  THE  ENACTMENTS  OF  JUSTICE

purpose  that  constitutes  their  specific  character.  It  behoves  us  to
unearth  more  of  these  laws  in  the  Florence  Archives  and  collate
them  with  those  of  Bologna  before  deciding  that  the  Enactments  ot
Justice,  so  peculiarly  connected  with  the  whole  course  of  Florentine
history,  were  mere  copies  of  the  Bolognese  ordinances.  Professor
Gaudenzi's  publications  do  honour  to  his  historical  research.  But  I
venture  to  repeat  that,  in  my  opinion,  the  question  cannot  be  really
settled  without  fresh  investigation  of  the  Florentine  rolls.  This  task
is  now  being  carried  on  by  Signor  Salvemini,  and  I  hope  that  he  may
make  some  new  and  profitable  discovery.  The  problem  is  interesting
enough  to  claim  solution.

CHAPTER  IX.'

THE  FLORENTINE  REPUBLIC  IN  DJNTE'S   TIME,

I.

FTER  the  enforcement  of  the  Enact-
ments of  Justice  (1293)  and  the  ex-
pulsion of  Giano  della  Bella,  the
Florentine  Republic  passed  through  a
phase  of  extraordinary  and  almost  deli-
rious confusion.  Its  incidents  are  very
familiar  to  us,  owing  to  the  splendid
series  of  chroniclers  and  historians  who,  from  that

that  occurred  under  their  eyes.  Modern  writers  have
also  studied  that  period  and  ransacked  its  archives ;
more  especially  Professor  Del  Lungo,  who  has  recently
given  proofs  of  an  industry  and  learning  which  cannot  be
sufficiently  praised.  Nevertheless,  I  believe  that  some
useful  work  may  be  done  by  trying  to  bring  all  those
facts  together  and  scrutinising  their  organic  unity,  in
order  to  ascertain  whence  they  proceeded,  whither  they
tended,  and  thus  explain,  if  possible,  the  primary  cause
of  so  much  disorder  and  the  real  significance  of  the  new
revolutions  undertaken.  I  may  also  add  that  such  in-
vestigation   might    prove   to   have    much    historical    im-

CLASH  OF  MATERIAL  INTERESTS,  485

portance,  since  it  concerns  the  time  in  which  not  only  a
nevv  art,  new  literature,  and  new  civilisation  first  sprang
into  being,  but  when  the  old  mediasval  social  order
was  decaying  and  fading  away,  and  the  society  of  the
Renaissance  beginning  to  take  shape.

In  the  midst  of  these  events  the  figure  of  Dante
Alighieri  stands  forth  in  giant  mould,  instantaneously
arousing  the  most  earnest  attention,  and  enhancing  the
value  of  all  his  surroundings.

As  we  have  frequently  observed  and  repeated,  the
history  of  Florence  runs  a  very  plain  course  down  to
the  year  1293,  through  the  series  of  wars  and  revolutions,
during  which  the  Guelph  inhabitants  of  the  city  first
attacked  the  Ghibelline  feudal  lords,  who,  castled  on
every  surrounding  hill,  impeded  all  trade ;  and  then,
having  conquered  them,  demolished  their  strongholds,
and  forced  them  to  dwell  inside  the  city  walls,  subject  to
the  laws  of  the  Commune.  Next,  the  people  were  com-
pelled to  combat  and  break  down  the  surviving  feudal
element  that  sought  to  assert  itself  in  the  city.  Before
the  year  1293  this  too  had  been  destroyed,  and  only  the
Grandi  were  left,  namely,  nobles  stripped  of  their  titles
and  of  the  old  feudal  privileges  of  their  class.  The
Enactments  of  Justice,  which  dissolved  their  associations
and  excluded  them  from  all  share  in  the  government,  had
increased,  on  the  other  hand,  the  strength  of  the  guilds
and  the  people.  These  accordingly  were  the  masters  of
Florence,  and  the  new  law  supplied  them  with  a  most
efficacious  means  of  continuing  the  persecution  and
routing  the  nobles  in  the  tribunals  of  the  State.  The
terms  Guelph  and  Ghibelline  were  still  retained,  but  had
lost  their  original  meaning.  The  old  aristocracy,  con-
stituting the  real  nucleus  of  the  Ghibelline  party,  having
now  disappeared,  the  city  was  wholly  Guelph.  The
general  condition   of  Italy   also    fostered   this   state    of


486    FLORENTINE  REPUBLIC  IN  DANTE'S  TIME.

things.  In  fact,  owing  to  the  fall  of  the  Hohcnstauffens
and  the  success  of  the  Angevins,  summoned  to  Italy  by
the  Pope,  the  Guelph  party  had  triumphed  throughout
the  Peninsula.  The  murder  of  Conradin  (1298)  had
proved  the  death  knell  of  the  Ghibellines.

The  triumph  of  France  was  more  and  more  assured,
and  during  the  interregnum  of  the  Empire  Philip  the
Beautiful  played  almost  the  part  of  an  emperor.  At  the
same  time  Boniface  VIII.  loudly  declared  that  the  Pope
stood  above  all  kings  and  princes  of  the  earth,  and  that
all  were  bound  to  yield  him  submission.

But  division  still  reigned  in  Florence.  First  of  all,
germs  of  future  discord  were  lurking  in  the  bosom  of  the
people  itself,  owing  to  its  subdivision  into  rich  people
{popolo  grasso\  or  the  Greater  Guilds,  and  small  people
(popolo  minuto),  or  Lesser  Guilds,  having  the  populace  at
their  back.  The  Greater  Guilds,  at  the  head  of  the
principal  manufacturing  business  and  the  vast  export  and
import  trade,  were  always  ready  to  undertake  fresh  wars,
which,  by  burdening  the  city  with  taxes,  greatly  diminished
the  internal  luxury  upon  which  the  Lesser  Guilds,  engaged
in  small  crafts,  depended  for  their  daily  support.  It
needed  little  to  convert  this  clash  of  material  interests  into
a  political  conflict,  especially  when  we  remember  that  the
Greater  Guilds  had  taken  possession  of  the  government
without  allowing  the  Smaller  Crafts  any  share  in  it.  For
the  moment,  however,  the  lower  class,  although  so
turbulent  and  numerically  strong,  lacked  cohesion  and
experience,  and  had  no  leading  men  at  its  head.  But
although  without  real  elements  of  political  strength,  and
still  incapable  of  forming  a  party,  it  was  excellently  suited
to  swell  the  ranks  of  already  constituted  parties  having  the
wit  to  use  its  aid  in  their  progress  to  power.

The  nobles,  on  the  other  hand,  although  defeated,  perse-
cuted, and  oppressed,  were  by  no  means  stamped  out,  and


UNDERHAND  PRACTICES  OF  THE  NOBLES.    487

still  retained  some  measure  of  influence  and  skill.  The
expulsion  of  Giano  della  Bella  was  an  instance  in  point ;
for,  by  contriving  to  make  the  people  believe  him  its
foe,  they  induced  it  to  desert  him  and  then  provoked
the  mob  to  attack  him.  Although  deprived  of  legal
authority,  the  nobles  were  still  practically  strong.  Always
boasting  of  their  victory  of  Campaldino,  they  had  un-
doubtedly played  a  prominent  part  in  all  the  greater  wars
of  the  Republic  in  past  times,  and  even  now  made  far  better
soldiers  than  the  popular  class.  As  the  wealthy  pro-
prietors of  town  and  country  mansions,  castles,  and  farms,
they  were  undistracted  by  commercial  cares,  and  had
more  leisure  for  military  pursuits ;  while  the  material
independence  they  enjoyed  made  them  all  the  more
sensitive  to  the  sting  of  political  ambition.  It  was  natural
that  they  should  seek  and  obtain  the  co-operation  of  the
populace  in  their  contest  with  the  burghers.  Thus,  in
junction  with  the  former,  they  constituted  a  vast  and
dangerous  body  of  agitators,  but  without  organic  cohesion,
and  all  equally  ineligible  to  office,  inasmuch  as  the  nobles
had  been  excluded  from  power  in  1293,  and  the  populace
had  never  been  allowed  any  share  of  it.


II.

At  this  time  the  world  began  to  perceive  what  results
the  subtle  craft  of  the  Florentines  was  capable  of  achiev-
ing. The  art  of  secretly  becoming  masters  of  the  State,
that,  at  a  later  period,  gave  Cosimo  and  Lorenzo  dei
Medici  such  triumphant  supremacy  in  the  Republic,
enabling  them  to  hold  sovereign  rule  while  remaining
private  citizens  in  the  eyes  of  the  law,  this  art  was
now  discovered  by  the  nobles.  It  consisted  in  leaving
republican  institutions  untouched,  and  showing  no  desire


4SS    FLORENTINE  REPUBLIC  IN  DANTE S  TIME.

to  be  concerned  in  them,  yet  contriving  that  none  save
personal  adherents  should  be  admitted  to  power.  The
offices  of  the  Guelph  Society  afforded  an  efficacious  means
to  this  end,  for,  as  we  know,  the  nobles  were  eligible  to
those  offices,  and  when  holding  them  could  declare  any
citizen  a  Ghibelline,  confiscate  his  property,  and  exclude
him  from  the  government  at  their  own  pleasure.  Thus,
without  being  members  of  the  Signory,  they  had  found
a  more  or  less  legal  method  of  preventing  their  worst
enemies  from  entering  it.  Giano  della  Bella  was  fully
awake  to  this  danger,  and  had  tried  to  avert  it ;  but  the
nobles  had  frustrated  his  purpose  by  compassing  his  ex-
pulsion from  the  city.

As  another  useful  means  of  regaining  their  forfeited
power,  the  nobles  managed  to  obtain  the  right  of  choosing
the  magistrates,  in  order  to  exercise  a  personal  influence
over  them.  Many  of  the  magistrates  were  foreigners  who
came  provided  with  foreign  notaries,  chancellors,  and  sub-
ordinate judges,  while  certain  others,  as,  for  instance,  the
Podesta  and  the  Captain  of  the  People,  were  necessarily
bound  to  be  knights — that  is  to  say,  nobles.  They  gave
judgment  in  political  as  well  as  civil  and  criminal  cases.
In  fact,  it  was  the  function  of  the  Podesta  and  Captain,  in
junction  with  the  Gonfalonier,  to  enforce  the  enactments;
and  besides  this,  political  and  common  law  were  so  inter-
mixed at  the  time,  that  it  was  impossible  to  separate  the
one  from  the  other.  Originally,  as  we  have  already  seen,
the  Podesta  was  the  virtual  head  of  the  Commune.  He
commanded  the  army,  signed  treaties  of  peace ;  and  even  as
ancient  historians  recorded  Roman  events  in  the  name  of
the  Consuls  in  office,  so  the  Florentine  chroniclers  regis-
tered the  events  of  their  city  under  the  name  of  its
Podesta  and  even  occasionally  of  its  Consuls.  But  towards
the  close  of  the  thirteenth  century  things  were  changed.
With    the    destroyal    of    feudalism,    the  development  of


THE  "  GRANDI"  AND  THEIR  ADHERENTS.    489

civil  equality  and  increased  recognition  of  Roman  law,
the  political  importance  of  those  offices  was  lessened.
The  Podesta  and  Captains  of  the  People  were  gradually
lowered  to  the  status  of  ordinary  high  judges.  Hence
both  they  and  their  subordinates  steadily  declined  in
authority  and  strength;  and  being  worse  paid  and  less
feared,  became  more  open  to  bribery,  and  more  easily  sub-
jected to  the  influence  of  the  nobles.  Many  of  these
officers  came  from  Romagna,  and  the  Marches,  and  the
greater  number  from  Gubbio.  Reared  under  tyrannical
governments  and  trained  to  Roman  law  in  the  school  of
Bologna,  they  had  no  previous  knowledge  of  the  real
significance  of  party  conflicts  in  Florence,  and  seldom
succeeded  in  acquiring  it ;  hence  they  also  failed  to  dis-
cern the  true  meaning  of  laws  such  as  the  Enactments  of
Justice,  which  were  mainly  political  laws.  All  this  con-
tributed to  render  them  easily  and  blindly  subservient  to
those  desiring  to  use  them  as  tools.  In  fact,  the  whole
literature  of  the  period  teems  with  fierce  invectives  against
**  the  wicked,  accursed,  and  perverted  judges  bringing  ruin
upon  cities."  ^

'  Many  just  observations  and  important  notes  on  this  subject  are  to
be  found  in  L.  Chiapelli's  work,  "  L'Amministrazione  della  Giustizia  in
Firenze"("Arch.  Stor.  It.,"  Series  iv.,vol.  xv.  p.  35  and  fol.);  and  Francesco
Novati's  "  La  Giovinezza  di  Coluccio  Salutati "  (Turin,  Loescher,  1888,
chap.  iii.  p.  66  and  fol.).  But  in  my  opinion  both  writers  have  devoted
all  their  acuteness  and  learning  to  proving  the  corrupt  state  of  justice  at
the  time,  without  dwelling  on  the  origin  of  that  corruption  and  its  notable
increase  during  the  fourteenth  century.  Its  origin  should,  I  think,  be
sought  in  the  changed  conditions  of  the  Podesta,  Captains  of  the  People,
chancellors,  notaries,  judges,  &c.  What  was  said  of  judges  in  the  four-
teenth century,  certainly  could  not  have  applied  to  those  of  the  times  of
Piero  della  Vigna,  Rolandino  dei  Passeggieri,  or  of  the  numerous  mediaeval
Podesta  wielding  so  much  power,  that  they  tried,  and  often  with  success,
to  become  absolute  tyrants  of  the  communes.  These  were  not  men  to
act  as  bhnd  tools  of  others'  party  passions ;  on  the  contrary,  they  strove
for  their  own  ends  alone.  It  may  have  been  owing  to  the  political  decline
of  the  Podesta's  office,  and  to  his  consequent  inclination  to  serve  party
strife,  that,  dating  from  1290,  his  term  of  power  was  reduced  from  one
year  to  six  months  (vide  Ammirato,  ad  annum).  Naturally  the  Captain's
term  also  had  to  be  similarly  shortened


490    FLORENTINE  REPUBLIC  IN  DANTES  TIME.

Thus  by  favour  of  the  lower  class  and  the  mob,  by  the
unjust  verdicts  of  the  Captains  of  the  Guelph  Society  and
the  corruption  of  alien  judges,  the  nobles  endeavoured  to
regain  their  lost  ground  and  again  seize  possession  of  the
government.  Nor  was  it  an  altogether  impossible  plan,
seeing  that  at  this  moment  (as  will  be  presently  shown)
they  received  powerful  foreign  aid.  But  unity  was
indispensably  required,  and  no  unity  was  to  be  secured
among  a  party  composed  of  not  only  different,  but  hetero-
geneous elements.  Accordingly  it  was  already  easy  to
foresee  that,  sooner  or  later,  the  fiercest  discord  must
inevitably  break  out  in  their  midst.

Dino  Compagni  remarks  in  his  Chronicle,  that  "the
powerful  citizens  were  not  all  nobles  by  birth,  but  were
sometimes  styled  Grandi  for  other  reasons."  i  The  Grandly
in  fact,  were  composed  of  ancient  aristocratic  families,
despoiled  of  feudal  privileges  and  titles  ;  of  old-established
burghers  raised  to  a  higher  position  on  the  score  of  their
wealth  and  of  those  proclaimed  Grandi  by  the  people  for  the
sole  purpose  of  subjecting  them  to  the  penalty  of  exclu-
sion from  power.  Naturally  the  old  aristocracy  were  full
of  distrust  and  contempt  for  new-comers,  who  often  con-
tinued (if  not  personally,  by  means  of  their  kinsmen)  to
carry  on  trades  and  manufactures,  and  thus  maintain  their
relations  with  the  rich  burghers  opposed  to  the  lower
classes,  whereas  the  latter  were  more  in  sympathy  with
the  really  influential  and  aristocratic  section  of  the  Grandi.
Nor  was  this  all.  The  latter  party  likewise  comprised
country  nobles,  such  as  the  Ubertini,  the  Pazzi  of  Val-
darno,  and  more  particularly  the  Ubaldini  owning  nearly
the  whole  of  the  Mugello  and  dominating  it  with  their
fortified  castles.  The  fortress  of  Montaccenico,  one  of  their
main  strongholds,  guarded  by  a  triple  circuit  of  walls,  had
been  founded  by  the  Cardinal  Ottavio  degli  Ubaldini,  who

»  "Cronica,"i.  13,  p.  57.


PROGRESS  OF  THE  GREATER  GUILDS.        491

has  a  place  in  Dante's  "  Inferno,"  and  who  once  said,  "  If
I  ever  had  a  soul,  I  have,  lost  it,  for  the  sake  of  the
Ghibelline  cause."  All  these  territorial  lords  clung  to  their
feudal  traditions  with  far  greater  tenacity  than  the  rest,
and  being  very  hostile  to  the  people,  were  equally  opposed
to  the  Republic,  which  was  always  at  strife  with  them.
When  residing  in  the  city  they  were  undoubtedly  com-
pelled, like  the  others,  to  obey  the  common  laws ;  but
in  their  own  castles  they  and  their  kindred  still  asserted
the  rights  of  feudal  barons.

In  order  to  sap  the  strength  of  the  Pazzi  and  Ubertini,
the  Florentines,  in  1296,  established  the  two  colonies  of
San  Giovanni  and  Castelfranco  between  Fighne  and  Monte-
varchi  in  the  Upper  Valdarno.  All  adherents  of  the
nobles  willing  to  settle  on  these  domains  were  freed  from
vassalage  and  exempted  from  taxation  for  ten  years. i
But  measures  of  this  kind  would  have  been  useless  against
the  Ubaldini,  and  prolonged  and  sanguinary  hostilities
had  to  be  engaged  with  them.  By  logical  rule  these  terri-
torial lords  should  have  been  Ghibellines  and  imperialists  ;
but  the  Empire  was  now  distant  and  feeble,  France  and  the
Pope  were  menacing  close  at  hand.  Accordingly  they
rather  tended  to  combine  with  the  Guelph  nobles  of
Florence,  and  more  particularly  with  those  of  ancient
descent,  thus  forming  a  new  element  in  that  curious
agglomeration  of  diverse  forces.  Also,  seeing  that  private
jealousies  and  hates  are  always  readier  to  burst  into  flame
when  unrestrained  by  the  organic  unity  and  common
interest  of  a  well-organised  party,  it  will  be  easy  to
understand  what  confusion  and  disorder  prevailed.

III.

Notwithstanding  the  powerful  support  of  one  kind  or
another  furnished  to  the  nobles  from  abroad,  and  in  spite
of  their  really  menacing  attitude,  there  remained  one
inexorable  truth  that  must  be  always  kept  in  view,  since
it  affords  the  best  explanation  of  the  phase  of  Florentine
history.  It  consisted  in  the  fact  that  the  aristocratic  faction,
doomed  to  decay  and  dissolution,  was  confronted  by  the
young  and  vigorous  party  united  in  the  Greater  Guilds,
bound  by  common  interests,  and  constituting  the  real
motive  power  and  future  of  the  Commune.  The  history
of  those  times  is  nothing  more,  in  short,  than  the  history
of  the  process  by  which  the  Greater  Guilds  succeeded  in
becoming  the  very  core  of  the  Republic,  in  spite  of  the
numerous  obstacles  in  their  path,  and  likewise  succeeded
in  eliminating  all  hostile  or  alien  elements.  For  some
time  past  these  guilds,  and  especially  the  first  five,  on
which  all  the  others  were  more  or  less  dependent,^  had
been  prospering  to  an  extraordinary  degree.  And  when
their  position  was  farther  strengthened  by  the  Enactments
of  Justice,  their  statutes,  with  the  amendments  then
introduced,  very  clearly  showed  that  in  augmenting  their
own  wealth  they  purposed  not  only  to  enrich  the  Repub-
lic, but  also  to  heighten  its  power.  Before  long  the  five
leading  guilds  jointly  constituted  an  Universitas  Merca-
torum  that  rose  to  the  authority  of  a  regular  commercial
tribunal  in  1308,  and  issued  a  definite  set  of  statutes  in
13 1 2.     Indeed  all  this  may  be  considered  the  main  part


*  The  Calimala,  or  Guild  of  Dressers,  Finers  and  Dyers  of  foreign
woollen  stuffs  ;  the  Changers  or  Bankers,  the  Guild  of  Wool ;  the  Porta
Sta  Maria,  or  Silk  Guild  ;  lastly,  the  Guild  of  Physicians,  Druggists,  and
Mercers,  with  whom  the  Painters  were  also  joined.  Dante  Alighieri  was
a  member  of  this  guild.

of  the  reforms  promoted  by  Giano  della  Bella,^  and  the
point  on  which,  favoured  by  the  conditions  of  the  period,  he
was  most  successful.  We  have  the  best  proof  of  this  in  the
fact  that  incessant  party  strife  notwithstanding,  the  pros-
perity of  Florence  increased,  at  that  time,  to  a  positively
prodigious  extent.  Villani  repeatedly  alludes  to  this  state
of  prosperity  and  general  well-being,  adding  that  continual
festivities  were  then  held  in  Florence,  and  that  the  Repub-
lic could  call  to  arms  as  many  as  30,000  men  in  the  city,
and  70,000  in  the  territory. 2  What  was  of  still  greater
moment,  its  bankers  manipulated  the  chief  trade  of  the
world,  and  flooded  all  markets  with  Florentine  goods.
They  conducted  the  affairs  of  the  Roman  Curia  ;  they
managed  nearly  the  whole  commerce  of  France  and
Southern  Italy  ;  all  the  sovereigns  of  Europe  came  to
these  bankers  for  aid,  and  frequently  employed  keen-witted,
enterprising  Florentines  in  their  mints,  their  treasuries,
and  their  embassies.  Thus  money  flowed  into  the  city
from  all  sides  ;  and  it  was  at  this  moment,  so  it  is  said,
that  Boniface  VIII.,  giving  audience  to  the  ambassadors  of
various  powers,  and  finding  to  his  surprise  that  all  of
them  were  Florentines,  cried  out,  "  You  Florentines  must
be  the  fifth  element  !  "  As  a  natural  result  of  this  state
of  things  the  petty  Republic  became  a  first-class  power,
wielding  everywhere,  and  over  Italy  in  particular,  a  pre-
ponderating influence.  All  neighbouring  cities,  great  and
small,  tried  to  copy  the  laws  and  institutions  they  deemed
the  source  of  its  amazing  prosperity.     Even  Rome  herself

the  author  notes  that  the  enactments  fixed  the  number  of  the  guilds  at
twenty-one,  that  this  number  remained  unchanged  from  that  time,  and
that  in  the  statutes  of  the  guilds,  the  year  1293  is  continually  referred  to
as  their  "  normal  year,"  "  wiederholt  geradezu  als  Normaljahr  "  (p.  244).

494    FLORENTINE  REPUBLIC  IN  DANTE'S  TIME.

seemed  desirous  to  organise  her  magistracies,  councils,  and
Commune  on  the  Florentine  pattern.*

It  was  this  that  most  irritated  the  Popes  in  their
perpetual  struggle  with  the  Roman  municipality,  and  now
specially  irritated  Boniface  VIII.,  who  seemed  determined
to  crush  the  Commune.  But  he  was  strenuously  opposed
by  the  nobility  and  people,  who  gave  him  no  truce,  and
drove  him  to  wander,  almost  a  fugitive,  from  town  to
town.  Of  haughty  temper  and  boundless  ambition,  his
conception  of  the  papal  authority  rose  to  the  height  of
craving  universal  rule.  Hence  he  could  not  be  resigned
to  the  stubbornness  of  the  Romans,  and  still  less  to  the
example  and  encouragement  afforded  them  by  Florence.
He  therefore  conceived  the  plan  of  subduing  the  latter
city  and  reducing  it  almost  to  the  condition  of  a  fief  of  the
Church,  under  a  governor  of  his  own  choice.  Having
once  formed  this  scheme,  he  began  to  prosecute  it  with
his  customary  ardour.  There  was  certainly  a  good  chance
of  success,  save  for  one  insurmountable  obstacle  that
he  omitted  to  take  into  account.  The  chance  in  his
favour  was  the  fact  that  Florence,  being  now  a  republic
of  traders,  had  small  means  of  offering  armed  resistance.
The  army  of  100,000  men,  so  proudly  enumerated  by
Villani,  consisted  of  a  species  of  national  guard  of  artisans
and  peasants  having  the  barest  smattering  of  military
training,  with  no  officers  and  no  generals  fitted  to  take
command.  It  comprised  no  mounted  troops,  since
nobles  alone  could  find  time  for  the  requisite  cavalry
training.  The  Commune  naturally  feared  to  place  any
trust  in  the  nobles  of  the  town,  while  those  of  the
territory  were  avowedly  hostile.  The  Companies  of
Adventure,  afterwards  open  to  hire,  had  not  yet  begun
to  be   established.     Nevertheless,  an  army  was  needed,

CIVIL   WAR  BARELY  AVERTED,  495

and,  moreover,  one  commanded  by  competent  leaders,  if
the  Republic  wished  to  preserve  its  authority  in  Italy,  and
protect  its  trade  from  the  growing  jealousy  of  its  neigh-
bours. This  was  the  reason  formerly  inducing  its  rash
acceptance  of  Vicars  nominated  by  the  Popes,  and  that
had  also  induced  it  to  confer  supremacy  for  ten  years  on
Charles  of  Anjou,  who  had  accordingly  supplied  the  State
with  captains  and  soldiery.  Why  should  not  Boniface  be
able  to  clench  a  similar  bargain  on  even  more  effective
and  permanent  terms  }  The  Republic's  need  of  a  military
leader  was  as  urgent,  nay,  more  urgent  than  before  ;
while  the  consent  and  support  of  the  nobles  might  be
considered  assured.  But  the  insurmountable  obstacle,
unforeseen  by  the  Pope,  was  that  the  Florentines  had
always  wanted  and  still  wanted  defenders,  but  refused
to  have  rulers  ;  nor  would  it  be  easy  to  induce  them  to
yield  this  point,  either  by  craft  or  persuasion.  The
subject  on  which  they  were  most  tenacious,  and  would
never  give  way,  was  the  popular  government  of  the
guilds,  and  this  government  would  have  to  be  destroyed
or  reduced  to  submission  before  the  Pope's  scheme  could
be  carried  into  effect.

The  task  certainly  had  its  difficulties.  In  fact,  the
problem  could  only  be  solved  by  force,  and  Boniface  was
not  the  man  to  shrink  from  employing  it ;  hence  collision
was  unavoidable.  As  an  additional  complication,  the
Republic,  about  to  bear  the  brunt  of  the  Pope's  fury,  was
thoroughly  and  determinately  Guelph,  not  only  Guelph
from  sentiment  or  by  force  of  old  traditions,  but  even
more  from  motives  of  interest.  In  fact,  it  had  risen  to
existence  by  centuries  of  struggle  with  powerful  Ghibel-
lines  and  aristocrats,  and  had  finally  built  up  the  govern-
ment of  the  guilds  on  the  ruins  of  those  adversaries'
strength,  and  greatly  assisted  therein  by  the  success  of
the   Angevins   summoned   to   Italy  by  the  Popes.     The


496    FLORENTINE  REPUBLIC  IN  DANTE'S  TIME,

chief  trade  of  the  Republic,  and  main  source  of  its  vitality
and  power,  was  that  carried  on  with  France,  with  Southern
Italy — now  held  by  the  Angevins — and  with  Rome.
Hence  it  could  not  entertain  the  idea  of  rousing  the
enmity  of  the  French  king,  Pope,  and  Angevins,  who
were  all  allied  at  the  time.  Besides,  the  Ghibelline  party
in  Tuscany  was  then  represented  by  all  the  cities  hostile
to  Florence.  Sienna,  Arezzo,  and  Pistoia  inclined  more
or  less  openly  to  the  Ghibelline  side.  The  Pisan  Republic,
which  had  so  zealously  assisted  Conradin's  cause,  still
flaunted  the  Ghibelline  flag.  This  State  was  in  perpetual
rivalry  with  Florence,  and  sought  to  bar  her  from  access
to  the  sea,  the  command  of  which  was  now  more  pressingly
needed  than  before.  The  strife  between  these  republics
could  only  end  in  the  annihilation  of  the  one  or  the  other.
Therefore  the  Florentines  were  compelled  to  keep  on
good  terms  with  the  Pope,  yet  at  the  same  time  forced
into  opposition  against  him.  In  this  condition  of  aff^airs
all  will  understand  why  Florentine  history  should  be  so
complicated  and  obscure.

IV.

After  the  expulsion  of  Giano  della  Bella,  the  nobles
seemed  again  masters  of  the  city  for  a  time  ;  and  their
spirits  were  immoderately  raised  by  their  success  in  pro-
curing the  election  of  a  Signory  (June  1 5, 1 295)  exclusively
composed  of  their  own  friends.  By  the  beginning  of
July  they  had  concerted  their  plans,  and  repaired  to  the
Piazza  armed  for  the  fray.  But  the  people  were  already
gathered  there  and  in  superior  force,  so  that  civil  war
would  have  instantly  broken  out  had  not  certain  friars
and  citizens  intervened,  and  fortunately  contrived  to
pacify  the  public  excitement.  Nevertheless,  the  Signory
being  favourable  to  the  nobles,  determined  to  turn  the


THE  DOi\ATI  AND  CERCHI  FACTIONS.        497

opportunity  to  account,  and  on  July  6,  1295,  managed  to
get  the  Bill  passed  that,  as  we  have  previously  related,
was  incorporated  in  the  enactments  for  the  purpose
of  modifying  them  and  considerably  attenuating  their
severity. 'f

Some  of  these  modifications  were  of  a  purely  formal
kind,  but  others  encroached  on  the  substance  of  the  law.
As  the  enactments  now  stood,  accomplices  in  the  offences
decreed  punishable  were  no  longer  classed  with  the  direct
authors  of  crimes,  a  single  Capitanus  homicidii  now  being
recognised.  Nor  was  the  testimony  of  two  witnesses  of
good  repute  any  longer  considered  sufficient  proof  of  the
crime,  the  testimony  of  three  witnesses  now  being
required.  Finally  it  was  no  longer  indispensable  that
candidates  to  the  Signory  should  be  practically  engaged
in  some  trade,  continue  artem  exercentes ;  their  enrolment
in  the  guild  of  the  trade  being  decreed  sufficient  proof  of
their  eligibility,  gut  scripti  sint  in  libro  seu  matricola
alicuius  artis.  This  last  concession  was,  in  fact,  slighter
than  it  appeared,  seeing  that  even  before  then  the  practical
exercise  of  trade  had  been  more  often  apparent  than  real.
But  the  principle  for  which  men  had  fought  was  now
cast  aside,  and  putting  together  the  various  concessions
granted  in  1295,  we  plainly  see  that  the  amendment  of
the  law  was  a  genuine  victory  for  the  nobles.  In  fact,  the
popular  discontent  ran  high  at  the  passing  of  this  Bill,  and
Villani  tells  us  that  the  Signory  who  had  proposed  and
carried  it  were  treated  with  much  contumely  and  scorn  on
leaving  office,  and  even  greeted  with  volleys  of  stones
in  the  public  streets.^  Accordingly  a  popular  reaction
ensued  that  proved  to  be  the  germ  of  new  and  serious
discord  among  the  citizens.     The  first  step  taken  was  to

deprive  the  nobles  of  certain  of  their  weapons  ;  the  next
to  proclaim  some  of  the  less  factious  aristocrats  members
of  the  popular  class,  in  order  to  weaken  their  party. »
Besides  this,  fresh  laws  were  soon  decreed  to  restore  the
pristine  force  of  the  enactments,  followed  by  other
measures  of  the  same  kind,  culminating  in  the  creation  of
a  new  magistrate  for  the  express  purpose,  as  will  be  seen,
of  ensuring  the  strict  fulfilment  of  the  law.  But  it  was
impossible  for  these  changes  to  be  effected  without  fresh
discord  and  bloodshed  in  the  city.

For  there  was  not  only  fiercer  strife  just  then  between
the  nobles  and  the  people,  but  the  former  now  split  into
two  divisions,  formed  respectively  of  those  bent  on  doing
away  with  the  enactments,  and  those  who  had  renounced
that  idea.     These  new  factions  were  designated  by  the
names  of  the  two  families  acting  as  leaders,  namely,  the
Donati  and  the  Cerchi.     The  latter  were  of  humble  origin,
but  had  made  their  way  up  and  were  now  counted  among
the  richest  merchants  in  the  world.     They  boasted  a  wide-
spreading  kindred,  numerous  friends,  owned  vast  estates
both  in  town   and   country,   and   lived  in  grand  style.
They  had  recently  purchased  many  palaces  of  the  Counts
Guidi,  members  of  the  oldest  Florentine   nobility ;  and
by  lending  their  houses  at  St.  Procolo  to  the  Signory,  to
whom  no  palace  had  yet  been  assigned,  were  more  easily
enabled  to  keep  in  favour  with  the  heads  of  the  State.
Villani,  being  of  the  opposite  party,  says  that  the  Cerchi
were   "  easy-going,  innocent,  and  savage."     They  were,
in  fact,  business  folk,  unpractised  in   warfare,  and  with
small  aptitude  for  political  intrigue.     The  term  "  savage  "
was  applied  to  them  on  account  of  their  humble  descent,
and  Dante  himself,  though  an  adherent  of  their  party,

proclaimed  men  of  the  people.


THE  BIANCHI  AND  NERt.  499

I  speaks  of  it  as  "  savage  "  {selvaggid).  In  virtue  of  their
i  origin  and  continued  practice  of  trade,  they  were  liked
'  and  esteemed  by  the  people,  and  their  avowed  opposition
to  the  Donati  ^  won  them  still  higher  favour.  Besides
the  advantages  of  wealth  and  of  wide-spreading  family
ties,  their  courtesy  of  manner  helped  to  advance  their
popularity.

On  the  contrary,  the  "  gentle-born  and  warlike  *'
Donati,  as  Villani  calls  them,  were  of  old  feudal  descent.
Messer  Corso,  the  head  of  the  family,  was  a  daring,
shrewd,  hard-hitting  man,  of  moderate  means,  but  so
immoderately  haughty  and  ambitious  as  to  tolerate  no
equals,  and  least  of  all  among  the  enriched  merchants.
He  was  known  as  the  baron,  and  Compagni,  who  was  on
the  Cerchi  side,  says  that  whenever  Corso  rode  through  the
streets,  "  he  seemed  the  lord  of  the  earth  "  ("  che  la  terra
^osse  sua  ").  Many  magnates  of  the  city,  many  nobles  of
1  the  territory,  and  particularly  the  Pazzi  of  the  Upper
Valdarno,  considered  him  their  leader.  Some  of  the
merchants  also  adhered  to  him,  and  among  others  the
Spini,  who  owned  a  bank  in  Rome,  and  as  business  agents
for  the  Pope  and  the  Curia,  drove  a  very  profitable  trade.
This  Donati  faction  was  detested  by  the  burghers,  but  in
favour  with  the  populace,  who  greeted  the  baron  with
shouts  of  applause  as  he  passed  through  the  streets.  But
although  Corso's  courage  and  subtlety  stood  him  in  good
stead  during  the  struggle  now  impending,  his  arrogance
alienated  many  followers  and  disposed  them  to  join  the
'  Cerchi.  The  Cavalcanti  were  among  his  opponents,  and
that   graceful  poet    and  valorous  knight,  young    Guido

»  The  chroniclers  have  much  to  relate  on  this  subject.  Compagni  says
(pp.  86-7)  that  the  Cerchi  "  made  friends  with  the  people  and  the  rulers ; "
farther  on  he  remarks  that  "  all  holding  the  views  of  Giano  della  Bella
gathered  round  them  "  (the  Cerchi)  (p,  106).  Stefani  (iv.  p.  220)  states
that  the  people  "  adhered  to  the  Cerchi  from  party  spirit,  and  chiefly
because  they  were  merchants."


Soo    FLORENTINE  REPUBLIC  IN  DANTE S  TIME.

Cavalcanti,  had  conceived  so  special  and  deadly  a  hatred
for  him  that  the  two  never  met  in  the  streets  without  draw-
ing their  swords.  The  Donati's  influence  in  the  city  was
chiefly  owed  to  the  favour  of  the  captains  of  the  party,
while  that  of  the  Cerchi  was  maintained  by  the  support  of
the  Signory.  Thus  the  palace  of  the  Guelph  Society  and
of  the  Priors  became  the  headquarters,  as  it  were,  of  the
two  opposing  camps.  The  two  families  likewise  owned
neighbouring  estates  in  the  country  and  dwelt  near  each
other  in  town.  Their  respective  houses  were  situated  in
the  St.  Piero  quarter  or  sesto  of  the  city,  which,  on  account
of  the  continual  disturbances  occurring  there  at  the  time,
was  known  by  the  name  of  "  The  Scandalous  Sesto  "  {Sesto
dello  Scandalo).  Everything  served  as  fuel  to  the  flame.
Words  uttered  by  either  party  were  reported  and  exag-
gerated to  the  other.  How  Corso  Donati  always  spoke
of  Guido  Cavalcanti  as  Guido  Cavicchia  ;  how,  when
alluding  to  the  head  of  the  family  and  party  chief,  Vieri
de'  Cerchi,  he  would  ask,  "  Has  the  ass  of  Porta  brayed
to-day  .? "  On  the  other  hand,  the  Donati  were  styled
by  their  adversaries  *'  The  Ill-famed,"  as  being  men  of
bad  repute  and  doers  of  evil.

It  is  not  easy  to  exactly  ascertain  how  and  when  these
parties  first  became  known  as  Bianchi  and  Neri^  for  the
chroniclers  are  rather  vague  and  not  altogether  agreed
upon  the  point.  Both  names  were  of  old  usage  in
Florence  as  distinctive  family  appellations  ;  in  fact,  there
had  already  been  White  Cerchi  and  Black  Cerchi,  but  the
latter  afterwards  became  the  chiefs  of  the  White  party.  ^
The  same  names  had  then  been  employed  to  designate
two  opposite  factions  of  the  Cancellieri  house  waging
fierce  strife  in  Pistoia.  The  Florentines,  who  exercised
great  authority  in  that  town,  mediated  between  the  two

'  Professor  Del  Lungo  supplies  special  information  on  this  subject
in  several  passages  of  his  work.


THE  POPE'S  FIRST  MOVE.  501

sides  to  bring  them  to  make  peace  ;  and  to  achieve  this
intent  sent  some  members  of  the  Pistoian,  Bianchi,  and
Neri  to  Florence.  The  Whites  were  quartered  in  the
Frescobaldi  palace,  the  Blacks  in  the  house  of  certain
Cerchi,  to  whom  they  were  related.  But  this  measure
had  a  very  unexpected  result,  for,  as  Villani  '^  remarks,
even  as  one  sick  sheep  infects  another  with  disease,  so
the  Pistoians  communicated  their  party  hatred  to  the
Florentines,  who  thus  became  increasingly  divided.  At
ail  events,  from  that  time  the  Donati  were  Blacks,  the
Cerchi  Whites.

Hence  it  may  be  clearly  seen  that  this  division  of
parties  no  longer  corresponds  with  that  of  the  Guelphs
and  Ghibellines.  Principles  are  set  aside  and  personal
passions  and  hatreds  more  and  more  dominant.  But,  in
the  nature  of  things,  no  Florentine  family  at  the  time
could  have  a  better  claim  to  be  entitled  Ghibellines  than
the  Donati,  a  line  boasting  feudal  descent,  and  connected
with  the  oldest  nobility  of  the  city  and  its  territory.  The
head  of  the  house  was  Messer  Corso,  who,  after  the  death
of  his  first  wife,  contracted  a  second  marriage  with  one
of  the  Ubertini,  an  old  Ghibelline  family  that  had  been
always  opposed  to  the  popular  government,  and  seemed
to  have  the  very  blood  of  the  tyrants  of  Romagna  and
Lombardy  in  its  veins.  Yet  it  was  principally  through
Corso  Donati  that  events  again  took  another  unexpected
turn.  Spurred  by  his  devouring  ambition,  he  started  a
j secret  intrigue  with  Boniface  VIII.  through  his  Roman
I  agents,  the  Spini,  and  the  Pope  believed  that  at  last  he
had  found  a  man  after  his  own  heart.  2  And  before  very
long  these  secret  practices  produced  visible  results.

The  Pope's  purpose  of  exercising  undue  interference  in
Florentine  affairs  was  plainly  seen  when  the  question  was
discussed  as  to  revoking  the  banishment  of  Giano  della
Bella.  Though  without  any  lawful  voice  in  the  matter,  he
not  only  made  violent  opposition  to  the  proposal,  but
also,  on  January  23,  1296,  addressed  a  letter  to  the
Florentines,  threatening  them  with  interdict,  unless  they
abandoned  the  idea.^  No  one,  however,  was  yet  aware
that  he  had  already  formed  a  scheme,  and  was  secretly
plotting  to  carry  it  into  effect ;  nor  did  any  one  imagine
that  Papa  Bonif actus  volehat  sibi  dart  totam  Tusciam^
although  this  was  afterwards  ascertained  to  be  the  case,
and  written  proof  of  it  is  extant  in  an  old  document  that
serves  to  explain  his  real  aims.3  These  were  also  formu-
lated clearly  enough  by  the  chronicler  Ferreto,  when  he
wrote  that  Boniface  meditated  "  faesulanum  popolum
iugo  supprimere,  et  sic  Thusciam  ipsam,  servire  desuetam,
tyrannico  more  comprehendere."4  In  fact,  in  May,  1300,
the  Pope  had  already  sent  word  to  the  Duke  of  Saxony
that  the  Tuscan  factions  having  infected  his  own  States,  it
was  impossible  for  him  to  achieve  any  result  without  first
reducing  Tuscany  to  subjection.  And  he  continued  that
although  able  to  do  this  on  his  own  authority,  he  never-
theless preferred   to   gain   the   consent  of  the   electoral

princes,  and  likewise  that  of  Albert  of  Austria,  king  of
the  Romans,  to  whom  he  forwarded  a  minute  of  the  act
of  renunciation.  I  Donati,  being  privy  to  the  scheme,  had
hastened  to  assume  the  attitude  of  the  most  Guelph  of  all
Guelphs,  and  denounce  the  Cerchi  as  Ghibellines.  Con-
sequently all  who  distrusted  the  Pope  were  increasingly
willing  to  join  the  Cerchi  side.

Suddenly  Florence  was  startled  by  receiving  well  certi-
fied news  of  the  clandestine  intrigues  Donati  was  carrying
on  in  Rome  through  the  agency  of  the  Spini.  Messer
Lapo  Salterelli,  an  advocate  of  much  skill  but  doubtful
integrity,  and  always  ready  to  go  with  the  tide,  came
before  the  magistrates  accompanied  by  two  personal
friends,2  and  publicly  accused  of  treasonable  attempts
against  the  State  three  Florentines  domiciled  in  Rome
at  Spini's  bank,  three  "  mercatores  Romanam  Curiam
sequentes."3  Corso  Donati  was  not  in  Florence  at  the
time,  but  at  Massa  Trabaria,  a  city  in  the  States  of  the
Church  and  close  to  the  Tuscan  frontier,  where  he  had  just
been  appointed  rector  by  the  Pope,  a  circumstance  that
heightened  suspicion,  and  made  the  danger  appear  all  the
more  serious  and  imminent.  Determined  to  be  on  the
alert,  without  giving  undue  provocation  to  the  Pope,
the  magistrates  immediately  sentenced  the  three  citizens
in  question  to  pay  heavy  fines,  but  awaited  fresh  intelli-
gence before  proceeding  against  all  the  other  persons
undoubtedly  concerned  in  the  plot.  To  allay  the  sus-
picions roused  against  him,  the  Pope  should  have  now
maintained  a  prudent  silence,  but  his  impetuous  nature

brooked  no  restraint.  Therefore,  giving  vent  to  his  fury,
he  wrote  on  April  24,  1300,  threatening  excommunication
on  the  city  for  daring  to  sentence  his  own  familiars^  and
summoned  the  three  accusers  to  come  to  Rome  without
delay. ^  He  gained  nothing  by  this  move — on  the  contrary,
Lapo  SalterelH,  having  just  been  elected  a  prior,  raised  the
question  of  jurisdiction  by  denying  his  right  of  inter-
ference with  the  internal  affairs  of  the  Republic.  Mean-
while Boniface  had  called  Vieri  de'  Cerchi  to  Rome,  for
the  purpose  of  inducing  him  to  make  peace  with  Donati,
who  had  already  arrived  there.  But  Cerchi,  without
betraying  any  knowledge  of  the  trial,  merely  declared
that  he  bore  no  hatred  to  any  man,  and  alleging  other
vague  excuses,  declined  the  proposed  reconciliation,  thus
stirring  the  Pope's  wrath  to  the  highest  degree. 2  It  was
naturally  very  important  for  him  to  pacify  the  nobles,
since  this  was  the  only  means  of  compassing  the  subjection
of  the  people.  But  precisely  on  that  account  the  people
preferred  to  keep  them  divided,  and  therefore  throwing
its  weight  on  the  side  of  the  Cerchi,  vehemently  urged
the  latter  to  oppose  the  Donati.


VI.

Such  was  the  state  of  public  feeling  on  the  day  known
to  some  as  the  fatal  May  Kalend.  According  to  an  old
custom,  the  maidens  of  Florence  greeted  the  coming  of
spring  in  the  year  1 30c  by  performing  a  dance  in  the  S'^
Trinita  Square.  Crowds  flocked  to  the  spot,  struggling
for  ?  better  sight  of  the  festivity.  Certain  youths  on
horseback,  both  of  the  Bianchi  and  Neri  factions,  came
into  collision  while    pressing  to   the   front.     Hot  words

were  exchanged  followed  by  blows,  swords  flashed  out,
and  many  wounds  were  inflicted.  Ricoverino  de'Cerchi  had
his  nose  slashed  off,  an  injury  naturally  demanding  mortal
revenge.  So,  in  the  same  way  that  the  Buondelmonti
tragedy  was  declared  by  the  chroniclers  to  have  given
birth  to  the  Guelph  and  Ghibelline  factions,  this  May-day
festival  was  now  considered  by  others  to  be  the  origin  of
the  White  and  Black  factions.  ^  Yet  this,  too,  was  only
the  sudden  outburst  of  long  repressed  passions,  now  raised
to  boiling  point  by  the  plots  of  the  Pope.  In  conse-
quence of  these  disturbances,  the  councils  immediately
passed  a  decree  (4th  of  May),  granting  the  Signory  full
powers  to  reduce  the  city  to  order  ;  to  enforce  the  Enact-
ments of  Justice  ;  to  guard  "  the  ancient,  customary,  and
continued  independence  of  the  Florentine  Commune  and

many  perilous  innovations  tam  introrsum^  quam  etiam  de

to  Boniface,  and  accordingly  on  the  15th  of  May  the
Pope  despatched  from  Anagni  a  most  violent  letter  to  the
bishop  and  the  inquisitor  of  Florence.  He  made  com-
plaint against  those  "  children  of  iniquity  who,  in  order  to
turn  the  people  from  their  submission  to  the  Keys  of  St.
Peter,  were  spreading  the  rumour  that  he  sought  to
deprive  the  city  of  its  power  of  jurisdiction,  and  diminish
its  independence,  whereas,  on  the  contrary,  he  wished  to
enlarge  its  freedom."  But  he  then  proceeded  to  cry  :
*'  Is  not  the  Pontiff  supreme  lord  over  all,  and  particularly
over  Florence,  which  for  special  reasons  is  bound  to  be
subject  to  him  ^  Do  not  emperors  and  kings  of  the
Romans  yield  submission  to  us,  yet  are  they  not  superior

Vicar-general  of  Tuscany  ?  Was  he  not  recognised  as
such  by  themselves  ?  The  Empire  is  now  vacant,  inas-
much as  the  Holy  See  has  not  yet  confirmed  the  election
of  the  noble  Albert  of  Austria."  And  thus,  in  a  rising
crescendo^  he  threatened  the  Florentines  that,  failing  obedi-
ence, "  he  would  not  only  launch  his  interdict  and  excom-
munication against  them,  but  inflict  the  utmost  injury  on
their  citizens  and  merchants,  cause  their  property  to  be
pillaged  and  confiscated  in  all  parts  of  the  world  and
release  all  their  debtors  from  the  duty  of  payment."  He
again  inveighed  against  the  three  audacious  informers,
vowing  to  have  them  treated  and  punished  as  heretics,
and  wrote  with  special  acrimony  of  Lapo  Salterelli  for
having  dared  to  declare  that  the  Pope  had  no  right  to
meddle  with  the  tribunals  of  the  Commune.  And  he
wound  up  by  insisting  that  the  sentence  on  his  three
familiars  should  be  annulled.'

The  Florentines  refused  to  heed  his  words,  and  the  Neri
then  began  to  feel  anxious,  dreading  lest  the  White,  or,  as
they  already  called  it,  the  Ghibelline  party,  "  should
be  exalted  in  Florence,  which,  under  pretence  of  good
government,  already  wore  a  Ghibelline  aspect."  2  They
accordingly  induced  the  Pope  to  send  the  Cardinal  of
Acquasparta  to  arrange  the  pacification  of  the  nobles.
The  Cardinal  arrived  at  the  beginning  of  June,  at  once
requested  full  powers  to  conclude  the  agreement,  and
likewise  proposed  that  the  Signory  should  be  chosen  by
lot,  in  order  to  avert  the  disturbances  always  accompany-
ing their  election.3  The  Florentines  lavished  verbal
promises  on  him,  but  refused  to  invest  him  with  the
desired  Balia.  Previous  experience  had  warned  them
that  peace  between  the  nobles  meant  "ruin  to  the
people,"  and  a  fresh  proof  to  this  effect  was  afforded
at  the  moment.     In  fact,  the  Cardinal  had  barely  begun

to  dispose  the  nobles  towards  reconciliation,  than  they
rose  to  arms,  and  on  St.  John's  Eve  (23rd  of  June),  almost
under  the  Cardinal's  eyes,  made  a  violent  assault  on  the
Consuls  of  the  Guilds,  who  were  bearing  offerings  to  the
shrine  of  the  saint,  and  shouted  while  raining  blows  on
them :  "  We  are  the  men  that  routed  the  foe  at  Cam-
paldino,  yet  you  have  driven  us  from  office  and  power
in  our  own  city."  '  So  enormous  an  outrage  demanded
heavy  punishment,  and  as  the  Signory  was  then  com-
posed of  burghers  of  the  White  party,  including  Dante
Alighieri,  it  exiled  several  nobles  of  either  side  within
twenty-four  hours.2

The  Bianchi  promptly  obeyed  the  decree  and  withdrew
to  Sarzana  ;  but  the  Neri  rebelled  against  it,  and  only
when  threatened  with  worse  chastisement,  removed  to
Castel  della  Pieve  in  the  Perugian  territory.  It  was  said
that  they  had  ventured  to  resist  because  they  had  the
Cardinal's  permission  to  await  help  from  Lucca,  which  after
all  was  never  sent.  And  it  was  added  that  this  succour
was  withheld  because  the  Florentines,  gaining  some  inkling
of  the  scheme,  had  prepared  for  defence,  and  advised  Lucca
to  that  effect.  Whether  this  were  true  or  false,  it  is  an
ascertained  fact  that  the  public  wrath  was  so  hot  against
the  Cardinal,  that  the  people  aimed  their  crossbows  at  the
windows  of  the  bishop's  palace  where  he  was  lodged.  One
of  the  bolts  actually  struck  the  beam  of  his  ceiling,  and
so  greatly  alarmed  him,  that  after  first  removing  to  another
house  he  took  his  departure,  leaving  the  city  under  inter-
dict and  excommunication. 3     Nevertheless,  animosity  and

this  a  singular  fact,  "  seeing  that  the  evil  germs  of  discord  had  then  spread
through  the  mass  of  the  citizens."  Yet  the  fact  seems  easily  accounted
for  by  the  circumstances  related  above.

riot  continued  to  prevail  ;  and  before  long  the  exiled
Bianchi  were  permitted  to  return.  This  indulgence  was
accorded  them,  partly  because  the  climate  of  Sarzana  was
so  unhealthy  that  Guido  Cavalcanti  contracted  an  illness
there,  of  which  he  subsequently  died,  but  partly  too  because
the  Bianchi  nobles  were  on  far  better  terms  with  the  people.
The  Neri,  on  the  contrary,  joined  more  actively  than
before  in  the  Pope's  plots,  and  seconded  by  the  Captains  of
the  Party,  conspired  for  the  purpose  of  trying  conclusions
by  force.

Meanwhile  Boniface  was  pressingly  urging  Charles
of  Valois,  the  king's  brother,  to  march  into  Tuscany
from  France,  and  Charles  II.  of  Anjou  had  already
implored  that  prince  to  come  to  aid  him  in  his
struggle  with  the  Sicilians.  The  Valois  was  an
enterprising  and  cruel  leader.  During  the  Gascon
campaign  of  1294  he  had  hung  sixty  citizens,  and
slaughtered  the  inhabitants  of  Reole  after  they  had  laid
down  their  arms.  He  had  fought  in  Flanders  at  the
beginning  of  the  year  1 300,  and  after  capturing  various
cities,  had  compelled  the  reigning  Court  to  open  to  him
the  gates  of  Ghent.  Then,  after  swearing  in  the  name
of  the  king  to  restore  his  States,  he  nevertheless  sent  him
to  Paris,  and  in  violation  of  the  oath  he  had  taken,
annexed  the  county  to  France.^  This  was  the  man  now
summoned  to  Florence  by  the  Pope.  To  induce  him  to
come  promptly  and  with  good  will,  the  Pope  even  dazzled
him  with  hopes  of  the  imperial  crown.  In  any  case,  by
right  of  the  authority  he  asserted  during  the  interregnum,
he  would  appoint  him  vicar-general  and  peacemaker  in
Tuscany,  "  to  enforce  the  execution  of  his  purpose  there."*
In  what  that  purpose  consisted,  even  Villani,  who  was  on
his   side,   admits    that    Boniface  intended  "  to  crush  the

people  and  the  Whites. "^  Accordingly  the  Blacks  own
displayed  great  activity,  with  the  aid  of  their  adherents  in
town  and  country.  They  held  various  meetings,  of
which  the  most  notorious  and  turbulent  was  that  assembled
in  June  at  Santa  Trinita,  for  thri  purpose  of  urging  the
Pope  to  send  Charles  of  Valois  to  straighten  their  affairs,
and  declaring  that,  for  their  own  part,  they  were  ready  to
join  him  at  any  cost.2  Naturally  all  this  could  not  be
kept  secret,  and  in  fact  the  Signory  immediately  sentenced
the  conspirators  to  various  penalties,  Messer  Corso,  being
absent,  was  condemned  in  contumacy  to  confiscation  as
well  as  personal  punishment  ;  some  of  the  Blacks  were
relegated  to  a  fixed  domicile  ;  others  mulcted  in  2,000
lire  each,  and  even  their  friends  at  Pistoia  expelled  from
that  city,  for  the  greater  enfeeblement  of  the  party.

Meanwhile  Charles  of  Valois  marched  across  the  Alps,
and  the  same  summer  was  already  in  occupation  of  Parma,
"  cum  magno  arnese  equorumetsomariorum."3  Reaching
Bologna  on  the  ist  of  August  he  found  convoys  from  the
Bianchi  and  the  Neri  awaiting  him  there.  The  latter  party
had  already  handed  over  to  the  "  curia  domini  Papas  "  the
large  sum  of  70,000  florins  to  assist  the  expedition  which
was  now  absolutely  decided. 4  As  a  preliminary  step,
Valois  went  to  Anagni  with  500  knights,  saw  King  Charles
of  Naples,  and  made  arrangements  with  him  concerning
the  Sicilian  campaign.  The  Pope  hastened  tO| create  Valois
Count  of  Romagna,  and  afterwards,  in  the  name  of  the
vacant  Empire,  Mediator  [Faciaro)  in  Tuscany.5  So,
without  farther  delay,  the  Court  started  for  Florence,
joined  on  the  road  by  the  exiles  who  flocked  to  his  ranks.

His  mission  was  to  crush  the  Bianchi  and  the  people  and  to
uplift  the  Neri.  He  had  deliberately  undertaken  the  task,
but  rather  for  the  purpose  of  satisfying  the  Pope,  of  whose
support  in  Sicily  the  Angevins  had  now  pressing  need,
than  from  any  personal  motive.  In  fact,  knowing  that  he
could  never  hope  to  be  lord  of  Florence,  he  felt  very  little
interest  in  the  matter.  Nevertheless  he  counted  on  being
able  to  extort  a  considerable  sum  of  money  from  the  city,
and  to  this  end  brought  Messer  Musciatto  Franzesi  with
him  to  serve,  Villani  tells  us,  as  his  pedotto,  i.e.^  as  guide
and  factotum.  This  man  was  a  well-known  merchant  of
the  Florentine  territory,  who  had  made  his  fortune  in
France  by  illegal  as  well  as  lawful  means  and  had  been
knighted  by  the  French  king  in  reward  for  many
services,  among  others  for  having  suggested  a  device
for  replenishing  the  treasury  during  the  war  in  Flanders
by  debasing  the  coinage.  ^  Charles  of  Valois  hoped  to  gain
much  by  this  man's  assistance;  whereas  the  Florentines
regarded  the  said  pedotto  with  great  distrust.

On  the  1 3th  of  September  all  the  councils  assembled  in
the  palace  of  the  Podesta — Dante  Alighieri  sitting  among
them  that  day — to  decide  "quid  sit  providendum  et
faciendum  super  conservatione  Ordinamentorum  lustitias
et  Statutorum  Populi."2  This,  and  not  the  struggle
between  the  Bianchi  and  Neri,  was  always  the  main  point
with  the  Florentines.  Hence  it  was  resolved  that,  for  the
present,  everything  should  remain  in  the  hands  of  the
magistrates  of  the  Republic,  and  that  it  would  be  ad-
visable to  dispatch  an  embassy  to  the  Pope.     Whether

DANTE S  MISSION  TO  ROME.  511

Dante  Alighieri  was  one  of  the  ambassadors  sent,  as
isserted  by  the  historians,  has  been  no  less  disputed  than
ill  other  incidents  of  the  poet's  life.  At  that  time  he  was
irdently  devoted  to  politics,  and  although  belonging  to
;he  old  nobility,  was  not  only  enrolled  in  the  guilds  and
I  partisan  of  the  Bianchi,  but  thoroughly  at  one  with  the
people,  a  supporter  of  the  Enactments  of  Justice,  and
Dpposed  to  the  Pope's  designs.  From  the  1 5th  of  June
to  the  1 5th  of  August,  1300,  he  had  been  one  of  the  Priors
who  had  exiled  the  leaders  of  the  Bianchi  and  the  Neri.
In  the  "Consulte"  of  1296  we  find  him  combating  the
proposal  of  furnishing  a  subsidy  to  Charles  of  Anjou,  to
assist  his  Sicilian  campaign.  In  1301  he  took  an  even
more  prominent  share  in  the  debates  of  the  councils,  and
always  manifested  unchanged  opinions.  In  fact,  during
ithe  debates  of  the  14th  of  April,  when  it  was  pro-
posed to  supply  a  hundred  soldiers  at  the  expense  of  the
Commune,  for  the  Pope's  service,  Dante  twice,  at  least,
made  reply,  "Quod  de  servitio  faciendo  domino  Papas
nihil  fiat."  '  He  had  been  also  frequently  employed  in
other  public  posts  :  accordingly  it  is  quite  possible  that  he
jmay  have  been  sent  to  Rome  at  this  time,  as  many  of  his
Ibiographers  have  stated.  What  could  be  said  to  the
Pope.''  It  was  now  hopeless  to  expect  him  to  refrain
from  sending  Charles  of  Valois ;  but  in  addition  to
,soothing  him  with  fair  words,  it  might  be  neither  in-
jopportune  nor  useless  to  endeavour  to  make  him  under-
stand that  it  could  not  serve  his  purpose  to  expel  the
Bianchi  and  aggrandise  the  Neri,  seeing  that  the  govern-
ment of  the  city  would  still  remain  in  the  hands  of  the
guilds.  It  would,  therefore,  be  wiser  for  him  to  come
to  terms  with  the  people,  which  was  steadfastly  Guelph,
and,  once  pacified,  might  consent,  as  in  past  times,  to
accept  from  him,  in  the  future,  a  provisional  Vicar,  always

provided  that  the  freedom  of  its  popular  government,  its
statutes  and  enactments,  were  left  intact.  But  this
popular  government  was  precisely  what  the  Pope  was
determined  not  to  tolerate  any  longer.  Therefore,  with-
out many  words,  and  almost  without  giving  any  heed  to
the  ambassadors,  he  only  replied  to  their  arguments  by
saying,  so  Compagni  relates:  "Make  humiliation  to  us."
According  to  the  same  chronicler,  two  of  the  ambas-
sadors returned  to  Florence  without  delay,  but  Dante,
who  was  the  third,  lingered  in  Rome  for  a  while.  ^

'  One  of  the  first  writers  refusing  belief  in  this  embassy  was  Professor
V.  Imbriani  in  his  already  mentioned  essay,  "  Sulla  Rubrica  Dantesca
del  Villani."  Subsequently,  my  colleague  and  friend,  the  late  Professor
Bartoli,  applied  his  learning  to  a  re-examination  of  Dante's  entire  career,
in  vol.  V.  of  his  "Storia  della  Letteratura  Italiana,"  and  without  explicitly
denying  that  the  embassy  in  question  had  been  sent,  expounded  the
doubts  which  might  be  raised  about  it.  He  included  in  the  volume  an
essay  by  Professor  Papa,  who,  with  youthful  daring,  decidedly  disbelieves
in  the  embassy.  But  that  learned  scholar,  Professor  Del  Lungo,  asserts
that  it  really  took  place.  This  is  a  very  important  question  with  reference
to  Dante's  career,  but  very  unimportant  as  regards  the  general  history
of  Florence,  since  even  if  the  embassy  were  really  sent,  it  produced  no
practical  result.  Nevertheless,  without  presuming  to  decide  the  lengthy
dispute,  I  will  show  my  reasons  for  crediting  the  fact  of  the  embassy.

Although  Villani  says  nothing  on  the  subject,  it  is  mentioned  by  Dino
Compagni  (ii.  25),  the  authenticity  of  whose  chronicle  is  maintained  by
Bartoli,  Papa,  and  Del  Lungo.  Hence,  if  any  of  these  writers  intends
to  deny  the  fact  of  the  embassy,  without  denying  Compagni"  s  authentic!  ty,
he  must  suppose  this  special  passage  to  be  an  interpolation.  Yet  it  is
impossible  that  such  interpolation  could  have  been  made  at  a  later  date
in  the  fifteenth  century  manuscript  containing  the  passage.  Besides,  the
testimony  of  nearly  all  Dante's  biographers  has  still  to  be  dealt  with.
Leonardo  Bruno  (born  1369)  makes  very  explicit  mention  of  the  embassy;
Filippo  Villani,  Giovanni  Villani's  grandson,  who  expounded  the  Divine
Comedy  in  1401,  by  order  of  the  government,  speaks  of  a  mission  under-
taken by  Dante  "ad  summmm  Pontificem,  urgentibus  Reipublicae
necessitatibus."  Boccaccio  also  alludes  to  it,  but  far  more  indirectly  and
vaguely.  Certainly  the  latter  is  no  trustworthy  historian,  nor  were  the
other  two  contemporaries  of  Dante.  But  after  acknowledging  all  this,
and  even  granting  that  some  one  of  those  writers  may  have  borrowed
from  the  others,  and  likewise  admitting  the  theory  of  an  interpolation
inserted  during  the  fifteenth  century,  in  Compagni's  chronicle,  we  are  still
met  by  the  undisputed  fact,  that  those  who  studied  Dante's  works,  and
wrote  Dante's  life  at  a  period  little  removed  from  his  own  day,  and  there-


VALOIS'  ARRIVAL  AS  PEACEMAKER.  513


VIII.

Meanwhile  Valois,  with  his  usual  deceit,  and  to  hood-
wink, every  one  more  completely,  wrote  to  the  Commune
of  San   Gimignano    on    the    20th  of  September   in    the

fore  enjoying  better  opportunities  than  we  possess  for  learning  its  detaiii,
all  believed  in  the  fact  of  his  mission  to  Rome.

Until  fresh  documents  are  found,  what  reasons  can  be  alleged  to  justify
us  in  denying  it  at  this  distant  date  ?  In  no  case,  says  Professor  Papa,
could  such  an  adversary  as  the  author  of  the  "  Monarchia"  have  gone  as
ambassador  to  Boniface  VIII.  First  of  all,  however,  the  period  in  which
the  "  Monarchia"  was  written  is  still  disputable  and  disputed.  Professor
Del  Lungo  and  many  others  ascribe  the  work  to  a  much  later  period.
As  far  as  we  know,  Dante  was  still  a  Guelph  then,  but  certainly  no
favourer  of  the  Papal  pretensions  against  which  the  Florentine  Govern-
ment sent  him  to  protest.  Hence,  so  far  there  is  nothing  to  make  us
think  his  mission  incredible.

But  Professor  Papa  winds  up  with  an  argument  that,  as  he  thinks,
should  finally  dispose  of  the  question.  If,  as  asserted  by  Compagni  and
Aretino,  Dante  was  really  sent  ambassador  to  Rome,  and  departed
thence,  after  a  time,  without  returning  to  Florence,  how  is  it  that  the
decree  sentencing  him  to  banishment  should  set  forth,  as  it  does,  that  he
had  been  cited  by  the  Nuncio  to  appear  in  Rome  ?  According  to  the
statute, /o/'f«sfs,  or  absent  persons,  had  to  be  cited  by  letter.  Therefore,
if  the  citation  was  made  through  the  Nuncio,  it  proves  that  Dante  was
undoubtedly  in  Florence,  and  had  not  gone  to  Rome,  hut  forcnsis  does
not  signify  an  absent  person,  i.e.,  one  who  extra  civitatcin  manet,  but,  on
the  contrary,  signifies — according  to  the  statute — one  having  no  domicile
either  in  the  city,  coiiiado,  or  district.

Accordingly  Dante,  having  a  domicile  in  Florence,  was  not  forensis,
and  if  he  went  to  Rome  was  only  absent;  his  embassy,  decreed  in
September,  must  have  been  speedily  ended,  since  a  new  and  adverse
government  came  into  office  the  8th  of  November ;  and  Dante's  banish-
ment was  only  proclaimed  on  the  27th  of  January  of  the  following  year.
Together  with  three  other  persons  he  was  cited  to  appear  and  be  heard
in  his  own  defence  and  exculpation.  As  neither  he  nor  the  others
appeared,  and  none  of  them  would  have  consented  to  appear,  even  if  in
Florence,  they  were  condemned,  as  they  would  have  been  in  any  case.
Thus,  strictly  speaking,  it  cannot  be  said  that  even  in  this  instance  there
was  any  violation  of  legal  procedure,  although  in  those  days  legality,
justice,  and  humanity  were  trampled  under  foot  without  the  slightest
scruple.

Therefore,  as  Professor  Bartoli  admits,  there  is  no  absolute  proof  of
the  impossibility  of  the  embassy  in  question.  Even  if  Villani's  silence
may  seem  strange,  Compagni's  statement  to  be  considered  an  interpola-

following  terms  :  "  Be  assured  that  neither  the  Pope  nor
I  have  the  slightest  intention  '  de  juribus  iurisdictionibus
seu  libertatibus,  quae  per  comunitatis  Tuscias  tenentur  et
possidentur,  in  aliquo  nos  intromictere,  sed  potius  .  .  .
favorare.'"^  The  Florentines,  however,  were  not  to  be
tricked  by  these  false  promises,  and  on  the  7th  of  October
elected  a  new  Signory,  in  advance  of  the  usual  time,
trying  to  assign  either  faction  an  equal  share  in  it,  in  the
hope  of  effecting  some  mitigation  of  party  rancour.  But,
as  justly  observed  by  Compagni,  this  was  rather  the  time
"  for  the  sharpening  of  swords."  Valois,  being  at  Sienna
on  the  14th,  dispatched  ambassadors  thence  to  announce
his  arrival,  and  these  envoys  were  received  by  the  councils
in  full  assembly,  including  that  of  the  Guelph  Society.
Accordingly  many  Neri  and  Grandi  being  present,  and
joining  with  those  who  at  every  time  and  everywhere
invariably  go  with  the  winning  side,  they  all  vied  warmly
with  one  another  in  proposing  to  welcome  the  stranger
with  open  arms.^  In  point  of  fact,  no  one  was  inclined
to  oppose  what  had  now  become  an  unavoidable  necessity,
particularly  as  Charles  had  again  given  the  Florentine
envoys  at  Sienna  written  as  well  as  verbal  assurances  of
his  intention  to  respect  the  city's  laws  and  rights  of  juris-
diction.3  So,  on  All  Souls'  Day,  ist  of  November,
welcomed  with  great  pomp  and  display  of  force,  Valois
entered  Florence  as  "  Peacemaker,"  and,  as  Villani  says,
*'  with  his  men  disarmed."  But  in  the  "  Divina  Com-
media  "  Dante  describes  his  entry  thus  : —

tion,  the  fact  remains  that  the  embassy  was  credited  at  a  time  little
removed  from  Dante's  day,  and  credited  by  men  better  acquainted  than
we  can  be  with  the  circumstances  of  his  career.  For  these  reasons,
while  admitting  the  weight  of  often  reiterated  doubts,  pending  absolute
proof  to  the  contrary,  I  shall  retain  my  belief  in  the  embassy.

letters.


TRIUMPH  OF  THE  NERI.  515

"  Per  far  conoscere  meglio  se  e  i  suoi,
Senz  'armi  n'esce  solo  con  la  lancia
Con  la  qual  giostro  Giuda,  e  quella  ponta
Si  che  a  Fiorenza  fa  scoppiar  la  pancia."  '

His  troops  had  gained  so  many  recruits  by  the  way
as  to  now  amount  to  about  800  foreign  and  1,400  Italian
horse.  They  were  certainly  too  few  to  besiege  or  en-
slave Florence  ;  but  Valois  had  the  influence  of  Rome
and  France  at  his  back,  and  the  Neri  were  ready  to  fly
to  arms.  Hence,  assured  of  safety,  he  established  his
quarters  across  the  river  (Oltrarno)  in  the  house  of  the
Frescobaldi,  once  friends,  but  now  foes  of  the  Cerchi.
After  resting  there  quietly  for  a  few  days,  in  order  to
mature  his  plans,  he  demanded  the  lordship  and  custody
of  the  city,  with  a  view  to  its  pacification.  Accordingly
a  solemn  meeting  was  held  in  Santa  Maria  Novella  on  the
5th  of  November,  attended  by  all  the  leading  citizens
,  and  magistrates  of  Florence.  Valois's  request  was  granted
I  when  he  pledged  his  princely  word  to  preserve  the  city
in  good  order,  peace,  and  independence.  Villani,  who
was  present  at  the  ceremony,  and  favourable  to  Charles,
relates,  nevertheless,  that  "  he  "  (Valois)  "  and  his  troops
immediately  began  to  do  the  contrary."  In  fact,  by  the
advice  of  Musciatto  Franzesi,  who  had  connived  with  the
Neri  to  that  effect,  violence  was  resorted  to  without  delay,  '
,  and  all  Florence  rose  in  a  tumult,  perceiving  that  the
I  moment  for  assault  and  treachery  had  now  arrived.
The  Signory  being  attacked  by  the  Neri,  betrayed  by
Charles  and  forsaken  by  the  Bianchi  on  the  charge  of
having  allowed  itself  to  be  surprised  unprepared  for
defence,  was  utterly  powerless,  and  the  Republic  was  left
without  a  government.  The  new  Podesta,  Messer  Cante
dei  Gabrielli  of  Gubbio,  had  entered  the  city  with  Charles
de  Valois,  and  for  what  purpose  may  be  easily  divined

5i6    FLORENTINE  REPUBLIC  IN  DANTE S  TIME.

At  this  juncture  Corso  Donati  appeared,  sword  in  hand,
with  his  followers  at  the  Pinti  gate.  Finding  it  closed,
he  managed  to  break  through  the  postern  door,  with  the
help  of  friends  within,  and,  entering  the  city,  was  hailed
by  the  mob  with  the  usual  cries  of  "  Viva  Messer  Corso,
viva  il  Barone  !  "  Hastening  first  to  throw  open  the.
prisons,  he  then  went  to  the  Public  Palace,  and  driving
out  the  Signory,  compelled  them  to  return  to  their  homes.
Villani  relates  that  "  during  all  this  laceration  of  the  city,
Charles,  violating  the  terms  he  had  just  sworn  to  observe,
never  attempted  to  check  the  fray,  but  only  looked  on."  ^^
The  Bianchi  were  speedily  overpowered,  many  wounded
and  killed,  and  their  houses  sacked.  This  "  pestilence
lasted  for  five  days  in  Florence,  and  for  eight  in  the
territory,  armed  bands  scouring  the  country,  maltreat-
ing the  inhabitants,  and  plundering  and  burning  their
dwellings.  Some  of  the  worst  and  most  ferocious  ex-
cesses were  committed  by  the  Medici  family.^  By  the
7th  of  November  the  Signory  were  so  overwhelmed  wich
terror  as  to  suggest  a  decree  authorising  them  to  with-
draw before  the  legal  expiration  of  their  term.  There-
fore on  the  following  day  a  new  Signory  was  appointed
to  hold  office  until  the  14th  of  December,  when,  according
to  the  law,  another  one  would  have  to  be  elected  in  regular  I
course.  The  existing  Signory  hastened  to  announce  to
all  the  fortunate  triumph  of  the  Church  party  under
the  auspices  of  the  Pope  and  Valois,  by  whose  means
"  Populus  roboratus,  Status  et  Ordinamenta  lustitias,
iurisdictiones,  honores  et  possessiones  Populi  et  Comunis
Florentias  suorumque  civium  observata."  3  In  spite  of
these  very  hypocritical  words,  we  know  that  even  then

DANTE  SENTENCED  TO  EXILE.  517

no  one  dared  attempt  to  annul  the  enactments,  or  to
remove  the  government  from  the  grasp  of  the  people  ;
while  it  was  equally  true  that  with  a  Signory  composed
of  Neri,  a  Podesta  such  as  Cante  dei  Gabrielli  and  Valois,
with  Musciatto  Franzesi  and  Corso  Donati  at  his  elbow,
the  Bianchi  were  doomed  to  destruction.  In  fact,  the
work  of  pillage  never  ceased  ;  exiled  friends  were  re-
called, the  banishment  of  adversaries  was  rigidly  main-
tained, and  Charles  began  to  extort  money  from  the
citizens  by  threat.^  His  first  victims  were  the  members
of  the  late  Signory,  who  were  given  the  choice  of  opening
their  purses  or  being  sent  as  prisoners  to  Puglia,  an
alternative  of  which  the  meaning  was  clear.^

Meanwhile,  the  Pope  having  little  confidence  in  Valois,
or  in  the  latter's  scanty  knowledge  of  Florence,  and  still
adhering  to  his  plan  of  reconciling  the  magnates  in  order
to  crush  the  people,  again  sent  the  Cardinal  of  Acquasparta,
for  the  purpose — as  stated  in  his  letter  dated  2nd  of
December,  1301 — "of  seconding  Charles's  efforts,  by
checking  dissension  among  the  citizens  and  converting
them  to  peace  and  charity."3  These  were  vain  hopes,
however.  The  Cardinal  did  his  utmost,  and  arranged  a
few  reconciliations  and  even  some  marriages  between
Bianchi  and  Neri  ;  but  when  he  proposed  that  either
party  should  have  an  equal  share  in  the  government,  the
Neri,  backed  by  Charles,  made  the  most  vehement  oppo-
sition. And  as  the  Cardmal  persisted  in  his  fruitless
endeavours,  Messer  Niccolo  de'  Cerchi,  when  riding  out
I  to  the  country  for  a  day's  pleasuring  with  his  friends,  was
attacked  in  Piazza  Santa  Croce,  pursued  by  Corso
Donati's  son  Simone,  and  murdered  by  him  on  the  Africo
bridge.     But  in   the  course   of   the   struggle  the   victim

dealt  his  assailant  a  mortal  wound  that  soon  brought  him
also  to  the  grave.

As  Simone  was  Corso's  favourite  son,  it  may  be
imagined  how  this  effected  the  peace  that  the  Pope  had
hoped  to  establish  through  the  Cardinal's  mediation.
Messer  Cante  dei  Gabrielli  had  already  begun  to  pro-
nounce sentences  on  the  Bianchi,  which  were  subsequently
transcribed  on  the  first  pages  of  the  still  extant  "  Libro
del  Chiodo."  Four  of  the  Bianchi  faction  were  exiled  on
the  1 8th  of  January,  1302  ;  five  more,  including  Dante
Alighieri,  on  the  27th.  In  February  four  other  verdicts
were  issued  for  the  banishment  of  over  one  hundred
nobles  and  burghers  of  the  city  and  territory.^  Enraged
by  these  proceedings,  the  Cardinal  hurried  off,  again
leaving  Florence  under  interdict,  but  not  before  he  had
received  the  1,100  florins  assigned  to  him  on  the  27th  of
February,  1302,  in  remuneration  of  his  abortive  efforts.

In  the  meantime  Charles  of  Valois  had  gone  to  Rome,
though  for  what  purpose  is  scarcely  ascertained.  Com-
pagni  says  that  he  went  to  seek  money  from  the  Pope,
who  replied  to  him  :  "  I  have  sent  thee  to  the  source  of
gold  ;  now  profit  by  it  as  best  thou  canst."  It  is,  there-
fore, highly  probable  that  he  went  to  convince  the  Pope
of  the  impossibility  of  the  pacification  His  Holiness  had
dreamt  of  arranging,  and  that  the  only  thing  to  be  done  was
to  exalt  the  Neri  and  crush  the  Bianchi,  together  with  the
people  abetting  them.  Knowing  little  of  the  Italian
communes  in  general  or  of  Florence  in  particular,  he
failed  to  discern,  that  though  the  Bianchi  might  be
crushed,  not  so  the  people.  To  quell  the  latter,  nothing
short  of  wholesale  slaughter  could  suffice,  and  even  this
would  have  failed  in  the  long  run.

*  Vide  the  notices  and  documents  collected  in  Professor  Del  Lungo's
monograph,  "SuU'  Esilio  di  Dante,"  Florence,  Le  Monnier,  1881.  Some
fragmentary  information  on  this  subject  had  been  already  published  in
the  "  Delizie  degli  Eruditi  Toscani."


DOWNFALL  OF  THE  BLANCHL  519

At  any  rate,  on  returning  to  Florence  on  the  19th  of
March,  Valois  feigned  to  have  discovered  that  the  Bianchi
had  formed  a  plot  against  him  with  the  connivance  of
one  of  his  barons,  Pietro  Ferrando  of  Provence  ;  and  an
i^.greement  signed  and  sealed  by  the  conspirators  was
actually  produced.^  The  chroniclers,  Villani  included,
declare  that  the  plot  was  entirely  fictitious  ;  nevertheless,
the  agreement  in  question,  dated  26th  of  March,  is  still
extant  in  the  Florentine  Archives.^  Either  it  was  forged
at  the  time  to  furnish  an  excuse  for  fresh  arrangements,
or  was  drafted  by  Pietro  Ferrando  for  the  purpose  of
entrapping  the  Bianchi  and  giving  Charles  another
weapon  against  them.  In  fact,  he  immediately  subjected
them  to  fresh  persecutions.  The  heads  of  the  party  were
cited  to  appear ;  but  disregarding  the  summons,  they
hastily  fled  to  Pistoia,  Arezzo,  and  Pisa,  there  reinforcing,
the  Ghibellines  and  all  other  enemies  of  Florence.  Eleven
of  their  number  were  outlawed  as  rebels  ;  their  houses  and
property  confiscated  or  destroyed.

Having  dealt  the  Bianchi  this  fresh  blow,  and  secured
the  triumph  of  the  Neri,  Valois  took  his  departure,  but
not  without  obtaining  a  promise  of  further  subsidies  from
his  friends.  In  fact  20,000  florins  were  awarded  him  in
December,  and  5,000  more  sent  in  October,  1303.3  Mean-
while the  Podesta,  Messer  Cante,  continued  to  rain
penalties  on  the  town.  By  May  no  fewer  than  250  con-
demnations had  been  pronounced,  and  as  his  successor
pursued  the  same  course,  more  than  600  sentences  of
confiscation,  exile,  and  death  were  issued  during  the  year
1302.4  Villani  says  in  conclusion  :  "  Thus  by  the  agency
of  Charles  and  the  orders  of  Boniface  VIII.,  the  hated
Bianchi    faction    was   defeated    and    expelled,  wherefrom

great  trouble  ensued  later  on."^  Up  to  this  point  the
succession  of  events  may  be  traced  with  sufficient  ease.
But  from  the  moment  the  exiles  sought  friends  abroad,
and  waged  war  on  their  native  city,  it  became  increasingly
difficult  to  disentangle  the  chaos  of  parties,  and  com-
prehend the  real  meaning  of  all  that  took  place.  There-
fore this  is  the  moment  to  test  whether  our  previous
remarks  have  served  to  cast  any  new  light  upon  a  period
of  history  that  is  still  somewhat  obscure,  in  spite  of  the
close  study  and  deep  learning  devoted  by  so  many  writers
to  its  investigation.

CHAPTER  X.'


DANTE,  FLORENTINE  EXILES  AND  HENRY  VII.

I.

FTER  Valois's  departure  and  the  events
by  which  it  was  followed,  the  history  of
Florence  enters  on  a  new  phase.  The
exiles  united  with  the  nobles  of  the
territory  and  the  Ghibelline  cities  in
raising  a  rebellion  against  the  Republic,
in  order  to  pave  the  way  for  their  own  recall.  This
naturally  brought  about  a  temporary  reconciliation  and
agreement  between  the  magnates  of  the  Black,  party,  who
made  greater  boast  than  ever  of  being  the  only  genuine
Guelphs,  and  stigmatised  all  the  exiles  as  Ghibellines.
Pistoia  and  the  fortress  of  Piantravigne  were  the  first
to  revolt,  but  were  speedily  reduced  to  submission.
Then,  on  the  8th  of  June,  1302,  the  leading  exiles,  of
whom  Dante  Alighieri  was  one,  assembled  in  the  church
of  St.  Godenzio  among  the  Apennines,  and  arranged
explicit  terms  of  alliance  with  the  Ubaldini,  undertaking
to  compensate  them  at  their  own  expense  for  the  injuries
caused  by  the  war  to  that  family's  possessions  in  the
Mugello,  where  the  stronghold  of  Montaccenico  was  to
serve    as   headquarters    for    the   adversaries  of   Florence.

'  First  published  in  the  "  Xuova  Antologia  "  of  Rome,  in  issue  of
l6th  of  December,  1888,  and  16th  of  January,  i88y.


522       FLORENTINE  EXILES  AND  HENRY  VII.

Thereupon  the  Florentines  at  once  proceeded  to  ravage
all  the  lands  of  the  Ubaldini  on  either  side  of  the  Apen-
nines.^ By  tremendous  exertions,  and  with  the  support
of  Pisa  and  Bologna,  the  exiles  managed  to  collect  an
army  of  800  horse  and  6,000  foot,  and  in  the  spring
of  1303  beleaguered  the  Castle  of  Pulicciano,  appertaining
to  the  Florentines.  But  even  there  they  had  little  success.
The  "  people  and  knights  "  of  Florence  took  arms  and
hastily  marched  against  them.  The  Pisans  failed  to  send
the  promised  succour,  the  Ubaldini  remained  inert,  and
as  the  Bolognese  withdrew  declaring  themselves  betrayed,
the  Bianchi,  being  left  unassisted,  ignominiously  dis-
persed. So  the  Neri  returned  to  the  city  in  triumph,  after
taking  many  prisoners,  some  of  whom  were  killed  on  the
way  and  others  beheaded  by  the  Podesta.  They  after-
wards surprised  the  Castle  of  Montale  near  Pistoia,  and
ravaged  the  surrounding  territory.  Thus  the  war  seemed
at  an  end,  and  the  hopes  of  the  exiles  fallen.

But  at  this  juncture  discord  again  broke  out  in
Florence.  Preliminary  manifestations  of  turbulence  and
rebellion  had  already  led  to  some  fresh  sentences  of  exile
and  a  few  executions.  But  matters  now  grew  more
serious.  Corso  Donati's  arrogance  once  more  produced
its  usual  results.  By  disgusting  his  friends  he  drove
them  to  side  with  the  rich  burghers  they  despised.  Being
alienated  from  the  nobles  of  the  territory  who  had  made
common  cause  with  the  exiles,  he  tried  again  to  become
the  leader  of  the  more  intolerant  section  of  the  magnates,
and  curried  favour  with  the  populace,  declaring  it  to  be
unjustly  overtaxed,  merely  to  fill  the  pockets  of  certain
fat  burghers.  "  Let  the  people  see  where  that  great  sum
has  gone,  for  no  such  amount  can  have  been  expended  on

esilio  di  Dante."

the  war."  And  he  demanded  an  inquiry,  thus  beginning,
as  Villani  remarks,  "  to  sow  discord  by  a  feint  of  justice
and  compassion."!  Much  discussion,  great  turmoil  ensued,
but  nothing  was  done,  although  a  law  was  actually  passed
(24th  of  July,  1303)  granting  the  Podesta  and  captain
full  powers  of  inquiry  and  decision.  Meanwhile  much
irritation  was  felt  by  the  "  fat  burghers  "  against  whom
the  accusation  had  been  launched,  and  in  order  to  strike
a  fresh  blow  at  the  magnates,  they  obtained  the  recall  of
certain  exiles  belonging  to  the  popular  party,  who  had  not
broken  bounds.  They  likewise  recalled  a  few  of  the
Cerchi  family,  thereby  gaining  the  approbation  of  the
Pope,  who  was  much  troubled  by  the  disturbances  the
Bianchi  were  exciting  on  all  sides  and  even  in  cities
belonging  to  the  Church.^  Thus,  as  Del  Lungo  happily
expresses  it,  "  by  dint  of  fishing  magnates  out  of  the
crucible,"3  Corso  Donati  was  enabled  to  gather  about
him  more  than  thirty  families,  including  some  of  the
burgher  class  and  a  itw  returned  exiles.  Several  members
of  the  Tosinghi  house  were  adherents  of  the  Bianchi,  and
amongst  them  the  valiant  Baschiera  della  Tosa  was  one
of  the  exiles.  There  were  also  Donati's  former  foes,  the
Cavalcanti,  a  very  wealthy  and  numerous  clan,  comprising
members  of  all  parties,  although  more  Bianchi  than  Neri,
and  who,  as  the  owners  of  a  mass  of  houses,  shops,  and
magazines  in  the  centre  of  the  city  and  tenanted  by
merchants,  were  naturally  on  good  terms  with  the  trading
class.  Accordingly  the  Donati  no  longer  commanded  a
party,  but  rather  an  ill-assorted  crowd,  only  united  by
the  common  bond  of  hatred  against  the  people.  In  fact,
Messer  Corso  was  wont  to  say  that  they  were  all  "  captive

and  enslaved  to  a  herd  of  fcit  burghers,  or  rather  dogs,
who  tyrannised  over  them  and  robbed  them  of  power."  "^
Nevertheless,  the  real  magnates,  namely,  noblemen  by
birth  and  temper,  mostly  leaned  to  his  side,  while  those
unable  to  tolerate  his  insolence  preferred  to  play  the  part
of  spectators.  Another  of  Corso's  allies  was  Messer
Lottieri  della  Tosa,  Archbishop  of  Florence,  who  was
making  warlike  preparations  within  the  walls  of  his  palace.
In  opposition  to  these  confederates,  several  families,  such
as  the  Spini,  Pazzi,  Gherardini,  and  certain  of  the  Fresco-
baldi  had  banded  together  under  the  lead  of  Messer  Rosso
della  Tosa,  another  man  of  soaring  ambition,  who,  in
pursuance  of  the  policy  formerly  employed  by  Vieri  dei
Cerchi,  inclined  to  the  burghers'  side.  And  by  means  of
some  of  his  bravest  followers,  more  particularly  certain
democrats  of  the  Neri  party,  named  Bordoni,  "  serving
him,"  Compagni  says,  "  as  pincers  to  seize  hot  iron,"  2  he
daily  harassed   the  Donati  in  the  councils  of  the   State.


II.

Thus  matters  seemed  again  at  the  same  point  as  before
the  arrival  of  Valois.  In  fact,  we  see  Rosso  della  Tosa
and  his  following  combining  with  the  people  in  defence
of  the  Signory  ;  while,  on  the  other  hand,  Donati,  backed
by  the  captains  of  the  party,  was  continually  threatening
and  attacking  it.  Again,  the  citizens  daily  drew  swords
and  came  to  blows  ;  again,  robbery,  bloodshed,  murder,
and  arson  were  rife  in  the  town  and  throughout  the  terri-
tory. Even  from  the  tower  of  the  bishop's  palace  a
mangonel  hurled  stones  on  Corso  Donati's  foes.  Both
the    Signory    and    Podesta  were   reduced    to  impotence.

FACTION  FIGHTS  IN  THE  CITY.  525

Things  reached  at  last  such  a  pitch  that  recourse  was
had  to  the  very  strange  plan  of  transferring  the  govern-
ment to  the  Lucchese  tor  sixteen  days  to  see  whether  they
could  succeed  in  quieting  the  city.  They  re-established
order,  but  without  punishing  the  guilty  ;  consequently,
as  soon  as  they  were  gone  everything  went  on  as  before.
It  was  even  endeavoured  to  choose  a  Signory  (solely  of  the
people,  however)  approved  by  both  parties,  but  the
attempt  came  to  nothing.  ^  What  brought  the  confusion
to  a  climax,  and  rendered  it  permanent,  was  the  fact  that
whereas  the  split  between  the  magnates  and  the  people
had  caused  two  genuine  parties  to  be  formed,  the  division
among  the  magnates  now  convulsing  the  city,  solely
proceeded  from  the  ambition  of  Corso  Donati  and  a  few
others,  had  no  political  motive,  and  no  basis  of  general
principle  or  general  interest.  As  we  have  seen,  in  fact,
Donati's  following  comprised  magnates  of  every  shade,
returned  exiles  owning  friends  and  relations  still  in  banish-
ment, together  with  a  sprinkling  of  the  lower  class.  Nor
could  there  be  much  cohesion  in  the  ranks  of  the  adverse
party  supporting  the  Signory,  since  this  was  also  made  up
of  aristocrats  and  men  of  the  people,  conflicting  elements
whose  union  could  never  be  permanently  assured.  If  the
foes  of  the  Signory  were  held  together  by  Corso's  energy
and  ambition,  its  supporters  were  chiefly  united  by  their
common  hatred  for  him.  Therefore,  owing  to  this  pre-
dominance of  the  personal  element,  both  the  parties  were
exposed  to  perpetual  division,  subdivision,  and  change,  to
a  perpetual  shifting  of  the  pieces,  and  restless  passing  and
repassing  from  one  group  to  another.

Confusion  was  now  to  be  heightened  by  the  death  ot
Boniface  VIII.  (October  11,  1303)  and  the  election  of
Pope  Benedict  XL,  a  man  of  gentler  fibre  and  uncertain
will.     The  new  pontiflF  yearned   to  re-establish  peace  in

Florence  at  all  costs,  and  procure  the  recall  of  its  exiles  ;
for  the  latter  were  keeping  his  own  states  in  a  turmoil,
and  even  in  Rome  itself  he  had  already  encountered  so
much  opposition  from  the  nobles  and  people,  that  shortly
after  his  election  he  had  been  compelled  to  seek,  refuge
at  Perugia,  namely,  on  the  borders  of  disturbed,  restless
Tuscany.  Nor  was  it  now  possible,  amid  all  these
calamities,  to  count  on  any  help  from  France,  inasmuch
as  he  had  brought  a  suit  against  the  authors  of  the
criminal  attempt  at  Anagni  causing  the  death  of  Pope
Boniface,  that  had  been  actually  devised  by  the  king  of
the  French.  For  these  reasons,  and  at  the  earnest  solici-
tation of  the  Bianchi  in  Florence  and  elsewhere,  Pope
Benedict  dispatched  a  peacemaker  to  the  city  on  the  31st
of  January,  1304,  in  the  person  of  Cardmal  da  Prato,  a
supposed  Ghibelline.  The  Cardinal  arrived  on  the  loth
of  March,  and  tried  to  conciliate  all  alike  ;  magnates,
people,  exiles,  Bianchi,  the  Neri  led  by  Corso  Donati  and
the  Neri  under  Rosso  della  Tosa.  But  what  chiefly
disturbed  public  feeling  and  brought  confusion  to  a
climax  was  his  scheme  of  recalling  banished  men  and
reconciling  them  with  the  city.  Nevertheless  the  popular
class  was  less  opposed  than  others  to  the  plan,  discerning
in  it  a  possible  means  of  enfeebling  the  magnates  by
promoting  fresh  discord  in  their  ranks.  Rosso  della
Tosa,  on  the  contrary,  was  decidedly  hostile  to  the
exiles'  return,  considering  that  this  would  strengthen
the  opposite  party,  which  was  already  favourable  to  many
of  the  banished  men.  These  views  were  shared  by  some
of  his  faction.  On  the  excuse  of  suffering  from  an
attack  of  gout,  Corso  Donati  remained  a  passive  spectator
for  the  nonce.  But  the  Cavalcanti  warmly  approved  of
the  suggested  treaty,  and  were  seemingly  the  first  to
promote  it.

Having   received   full   powers   from   the   people,  the

Cardinal  at  once  began  to  arrange  reconciliations,  and
with  success  as  regarded  the  Bishop  and  his  former
comrade,  Messer  Rosso  del  la  Tosa.  He  next  appointed
Corso  Donati  Captain  of  the  Guelph  Society,  and  re-
organised the  old  popular  militia,  on  the  original  plan,
under  nineteen  Gonfaloniers  of  Companies.  But  in  spite
of  bestowing  commands  on  some  of  the  magnates,  the
latter  murmured  bitterly  against  his  reforms,  saying  that
they  tended  to  increase  the  people's  strength,  that  the
Cardinal  was  a  Ghibelline,  would  end  by  leaving  the
city  in  the  hands  of  the  Bianchi,  and  that  the  latter
would  forthwith  claim  restitution  of  all  property  and
estates  made  confiscate  for  the  benefit  of  the  Guelph
Society.  Regardless  of  these  complaints,  the  Cardinal
persisted  in  holding  meetings  to  ratify  the  agreement.
In  fact,  on  the  26th  of  April,  several  Neri  of  the  Donati
and  Tosa  factions  exchanged  pledges  of  amity  in  the
Square  of  Santa  Maria  Novella.  Great  festivities  were
given  in  honour  of  the  occasion,  among  others  a  grand
performance  arranged  by  the  Company  of  Borgo  San
Frediano,  who  announced  throughout  Florence  that  all
persons  desiring  news  of  the  other  world  might  obtain  it
by  assembling  on  the  banks  of  the  Arno  on  the  evening
of  the  I  St  of  May.  Blazing  fireworks  represented  the
infernal  regions,  while  boatloads  of  masks  figured  as
condemned  souls  undergoing  various  torments.  The
people  flocked  in  vast  numbers  to  the  river  and  on  to
the  Carraia  Bridge,  which  being  only  a  wooden  structure
at  the  time,  gave  way  beneath  their  weight.  Many  were
seriously  injured,  and  many  others  really  went  to  the
next  world.  The  catastrophe  was  regarded  by  all  as  a
bad  omen,  and  was  truly  the  prelude  of  fresh  calamity.

ni.

Meanwhile,  those  most  opposed  to  the  recall  of  the
exiles  craftily  advised  the  Cardinal  to  begin  by  under-
taking a  mission  of  peace  to  Pistoia,  declaring  that  so
long  as  that  city  remained  in  the  power  of  the  Bianchi,
Florence  could  never  be  really  pacified.  But  the  Pistoians
resisted  his  efforts  so  vigorously,  that  not  only  was  he
compelled  to  leave  the  town  without  concluding  any
arrangement,  but  on  seeking  to  enter  Prato,  found  the
gates  of  his  native  city  closed  in  his  face.  The  Pope,
being  highly  enraged  by  all  this,  addressed  an  indignant
letter  to  the  Florentines  on  the  29th  of  May.^  But  they
were  in  so  disorderly  and  riotous  a  state,  that  after
imploring  the  Pontiff  to  find  them  a  Podesta,  they
refused  to  accept  either  of  the  four  individuals  proposed
by  him.  Yet  the  Cardinal  obstinately  clung  to  his  idea
of  re-establishing  peace.  At  his  instance,  safe  conducts
were  given  to  twelve  delegates  from  the  exiles,  six
Ghibellines  and  six  Bianchi,  in  order  that  they  might
come  to  Florence  to  settle  terms  with  as  many  represen-
tatives appointed  by  the  City,  each  Sesto  contributing  one
of  the  Donati  and  one  of  the  adverse  faction. 2  These
twenty-four  citizens  were  all  magnates,  and  felt  so  much
reciprocal  distrust  that  the  twelve  exiles,  although  well
received  by  the  people  and  quartered  under  State  pro-
tection in  the  Cardinal's  own  residence  at  the  Mozzi
Palace,  were  most  anxious  to  depart,  fearing  to  be  cut  to
pieces  at  any  moment.  But  they  were  advised  by  their
friends  to  take  arms  and  seek  refuge  in  the  houses  of  the
Cavalcanti,  seeing  that  with  the  latter's  help  they  would
be  enabled,  if  necessary,  to  repulse  and  overcome  their

FAILURE  OF  CARDINAL'S  iMISSION.  529

enemies  by  force.  The  Cavalcanti  seemed  well  disposed
to  the  plan,  and  began  to  arrange  preliminaries.  But
after  thus  rousing  the  suspicion  and  increasing  the
animosity  of  their  foes,  they  suddenly  drew  back,  thereby
disgusting  even  their  friends.  Accordingly  on  the  8th
of  June,  1304,  the  exiles  hurried  away  from  Florence  as
though  flying  for  their  lives. ^  Thereupon  there  was  a
loud  outcry  against  the  Cardinal  ;  he  was  charged  with
having  betrayed  the  city  by  his  stealthy  manoeuvres,  and
it  was  even  added  that  he  had  encouraged  the  exiles  to
appear  before  the  walls  in  warlike  array.  Letters  bearing
his  seal  were  shown,  and  it  was  affirmed  that  the  exiles
had  marched  from  the  Mugello  as  far  as  Trespiano,
and  only  beaten  a  retreat  on  learning  the  failure  of  the
meditated  scheme.  Villani  declares  that  these  reports
were  mere  slanders  ;-  but  even  the  epistles  attributed  to
Dante  Alighieri  lead  us  to  infer  that  the  Cardinal  really
desired  the  exiles'  return  and  had  negotiated  with  them
to  that  effect.3     But  his  patience  being  now  exhausted,  he

3  An  anonymous  and  undated  epistle  addressed  to  Cardinal  Da  Prato
by  the  Captain  Alessandro  (supposed  to  be  Alessandro  da  Romena)  and
the  council  and  university  of  the  Bianchi  party,  was  pubhshed  among
Dante's  Letters  as  one  composed  by  him  for  the  use  of  his  fellow-exiles,
and  was  long  attributed  to  him  by  his  biographers.  But  the  Captain's
name  is  not  given  in  the  old  manuscript  from  which  the  letter  was
printed,  but  merely  indicated  thus  :  A.  ca.  (E)pistle  I.  of  the  Fraticelli
edition,  Florence,  Barbera,  1863).

This  epistle  says  in  reply  to  letters  and  advice  from  the  Cardinal  that
the  Bianchi  are  grateful  to  him  and  disposed  to  peace.  "  Ad  quid  aliud
in  civile  bellum  corruimus  ?  Quid  aliud  Candida  nostra  signa  petebant  ?
Et  ad  quid  aliud  enses  et  tela  nostra  rubebant,  nisi  ut  qui  civilia  iura,
temeraria  voluptate  truncaverunt,  et  iugo  pias  legis  colla  submitterent,  et
ad  pacem  patriae  cogerentur  ? "  Therefore  the  gist  of  Dante's  words
would  have  been  :  The  desire  to  have  our  laws  and  hberties  respected
was  the  sole  cause  of  our  rebellion ;  all  that  we  now  wish  is  to  see
justice  and  peace  again  triumphant.  This  language  is  worthy  of  the
poet,  we  think.

But  doubts  have  lately  arisen  as  to  his  authorship.  Professor  Bartoli,
after  examining  the  subject  from  all  points,  and  ingeniously  discussing
all  different  theories  respecting  it,  concludes  his  prolonged  and  careful

departed  on  the  loth  of  June,  again  leaving  the  city  under
interdict,  and  exclaiming  :  "  Since  ye  prefer  to  be  at  war
and  accursed,  will  neither  hear  nor  obey  the  messenger  of
God's  Vicar,  nor  be  at  rest  and  at  peace  among  yourselves,
remain  under  the  curse  of  Heaven,  under  the  curse  of
Holy  Church."  ^

inquiry  by  stating  that  there  is  no  historical  evidence  to  prove  whether
the  letter  were  really  by  Dante  or  not  ("  Storia  della  Letteratura
Italiana,"  vol.  v.  chaps.  8-10).  Professor  Del  Lungo  says  that  the
style  of  the  letter  is  Dantesque,  in  its  merits  as  well  as  in  certain
defects  ;  but  that  this  fact  does  not  justify  liim  in  decidedly  attributing
it  to  the  poet's  pen,  since  it  may  have  proceeded  from  some  contem-
porary in  similar  circumstances.  Indeed,  after  examining  the  contents
of  the  letter,  he  considers  that  it  cannot  have  been  written  by  Dante,
and,  among  other  reasons,  chiefly  because  the  words  Candida  nostra
signa,  and  cnses  et  tela  nostra  rubebant,  &c.,  are  almost  identical  with
those  used  by  Compagni  in  describing  the  fight  that  occurred  at  Lastra
on  the  20th  of  July,  1304.  Hence,  he  is  of  opinion  that  the  letter  un-
doubtedly refers  to  that  event,  and  was  therefore  only  written  after
that  date.  And  seeing  that  Dante  had  separated  from  the  exiles
before  that  time,  Del  Lungo  considers  that  the  letter  cannot  be  by
him.

For  my  own  part,  I  doubt  whether  the  letter  really  referred  to  the
Lastra  affair.  Surely  the  words  in  question  :  "Our  white  ensigns
were  displayed,  and  our  weapons  flashed,"  may  have  been  used  either
in  reference  to  Lastra  or  any  other  battle  fought  by  the  exiles,  in
spite  of  their  resemblance  to,  and  apparent  translation  from  the
passage  in  Compagni  relative  to  the  fight  at  Lastra.  This  being  the
case,  without  altogether  rejecting  Del  Lungo's  view,  I  will  merely
remark  that  his  argument  is  insufficient  to  disprove  Dante's  author-
ship, since  the  poet  may  have  written  the  letter  in  the  name  of  the
exiles,  when  they  were  carrying  on  those  negotiations  with  the  Cardinal
on  the  subject  of  peace,  afterwards  leading,  as  we  have  seen,  to  the
despatch  of  twelve  delegates  to  Florence.  The  failure  of  those  nego-
tiations, the  cruel  slaughter  of  the  Cavalcanti  and  their  friends,  the
wholesale  destruction  by  fire  and  pillage,  the  partial  junction  of  the
Bianchi  with  Corso  Donati,  and  the  union  of  the  exiles  with  the
Bolognese,  Pistoiese,  Pisans,  and  all  foes  of  Florence,  immediately
followed  up  by  the  foolish  attempt  at  Lastra,  may  well  suffice  to  explain,
not  only  Dante's  indignant  withdrawal  from  the  exiled  Bianchi,  but
likewise  the  withdrawal  of  many  other  citizens.  In  fact,  the  latter's
non-appearance  at  Lastra  may  be  perhaps  assigned  to  the  same  motive,
as  we  shall  have  occasion  to  show  later  on.

THE  CARDINAL  LEAVES  FLORENCE,  531

At  this  moment  the  Cavalcanti  and  their  friends  were
at  a  truly  terrible  pass.  Their  present  junction  with  the
Donati  was  insufficient  to  blot  out  old  animosities,  which
had  been  only  laid  aside  for  awhile  in  order  to  second  the
return  of  the  Bianchi,  at  the  expense  of  the  Tosinghi
faction.  The  latter  remained  practically  isolated,  for-
saken even  by  the  rich  trading  class,  who,  wearied  of
perpetual  civil  war,  had  been  persuaded  by  the  Cardinal
to  promote  a  reconciliation  between  the  Cavalcanti  and
Donati.  But  the  former's  unexpected  withdrawal  at  the
last  moment,  and  when  all  seemed  arranged,  had  stirred
the  old  hatred  to  new  fury,  and  the  Cavalcanti  were  now
between  two  fires.  Messer  Corso,  being  unwilling  to  join
hands  with  the  Tosinghi,  kept  his  rage  in  check  for  the
nonce,  and  feigning  to  be  ill  with  gout,  still  remained
passive,  leaving  his  followers  to  do  as  they  chose.  But
Rosso  della  Tosa  was  a  ferocious  enemy  of  the  Caval-
canti, by  whom  he  had  been  brought  to  the  verge  of  ruin,
and  his  hatred  was  not  to  be  restrained.  So  the  Cardinal
had  scarcely  disappeared  before  a  catastrophe  became  immi-
nent in  Florence.  The  Cavalcanti  recognised  their  peril ;
but  they  were  numerous,  courageous,  and  powerful.  They
could  count  on  the  Gherardini,  Pulci,  and  Cerchi  del  Garbo  ;
they  owned  many  friends  even  outside  the  walls  and  among
the  exiled  Bianchi ;  they  had  also  adherents  of  the  burgher
class,  no  few  of  whom  tenanted  their  houses  in  the  centre  of
Florence.  The  foes  now  arming  against  the  Cavalcanti  were
aristocrats,  not  popolani.  The  Cerchi  del  Garbo  began  to
scuffle  day  and  night  with  the  Giugni.  The  Cavalcanti
and  their  friends  hastened  to  the  former's  assistance,  and
so  effectively  as  to  be  able  to  press  on  from  Or  San
Michele  to  Piazza  San  Giovanni  almost  unopposed.  But

give  the  date  of  the  loth.    This  is  also  adopted  by  Del  Lungo,  p.  563,
Vtde  Dino  Compagni,  "  Cronica,"  iii.  7,  note  26.


532       FLORENTINE  EXILES  AND  HENRY  VIL

fire  broke  out  there.  Their  enemies  had  set  the  Cavalcanti
houses  ablaze  with  combustibles  kept  in  readiness  for
some  days  past.  The  first  man  to  start  the  fire,  begin-
ning with  the  dwellings  of  fellow  associates,  was  Neri
degli  Abati,  prior  of  San  Piero  Scheraggio  ;  and  his,
incendiary  example  was  followed  by  many  accomplices,
including  Simone  della  Tosa  and  Sinibaldo  Donati,  Messer
Corso's  son,  J  It  was  the  loth  of  June,  1304,  and  a
strong  north  wind  was  blowing.  Accordingly,  the  fire
spread  with  great  rapidity  to  the  Calimala  street,  the  Old
Market,  and  Or  San  Michele,  thus  destroying  the  whole
centre  of  Florence  as  well  as  the  Cavalcanti  houses — in
fact,  as  Villani  expresses  it,  "  all  the  marrow,  the  yolk,  and
dearest  spots  of  our  city  of  Florence."  2  He  adds,  that
the  palaces,  houses  and  towers  consumed  amounted  to
more  than  seventeen  hundred,  with  enormous  loss  of
property  and  merchandise,  seeing  that  everything  saved
from  the  fire  was  stolen  when  carried  away,  and  that
fighting  and  pillage  went  on  even  in  the  midst  of  the
fiames,3  Paolino  Fieri  relates  in  his  chronicle,  that  one-
tenth  of  the  city  was  burnt,  and  one-sixth  of  its  whole  pro-
perty. Many  families  and  associations  were  ruined,  but
the  worst  sufferers  were  the  Cavalcanti,  who  seemed  para-
lysed with  terror  on  beholding  all  their  possessions  de-
voured by  the  flames.  Yet  so  ferocious  was  the  hatred
cherished  against  them,  that  even  after  these  cruel  calamities
they  were  driven  from  Florence  as  rebels.


IV.

Let  us  see  what  were  the  political  consequences  of  these
events.  The  Donati  and  Della  Tosa  factions  having
combined  for  the  undoing  of  the    Cavalcanti    and    their

'  Compagni,  iii.  8.  •  Villani,  viii,  71.  =  Ibid.


THE  RUIN  OF  THE  CAVALCANTI.  533

friends,  it  was  decided  at  first  that  the  magnates,  em-
boldened by  union  and  victory,  should  next  attempt  to
annul  the  Enactments  of  Justice,  and  take  the  government
in  their  hands.  And,  in  the  midst  of  the  General  dismay,
the  project  might  have  succeeded,  Villani  says,  had  the
nobles  been  really  in  unison.  Instead,  "  they  were  all  at
strife,  and  split  into  sects,  wherefore  either  side  courted
the  people  so  as  not  to  lose  ground."  ^  The  division  of
parties  remained  substantially  the  same.  That  is,  on  the
one  hand,  there  were  the  quarrelsome  magnates  seeking
upport  from  the  people  against  their  personal  foes,  and,
on  the  other,  the  people  trying  to  profit  by  the  magnates'
dissensions.  Of  course  the  merchants  had  also  suffered
heavily  by  the  fire  ;  but  their  wealth  was  of  a  kind  to  be
rapidly  replaced,  whereas  the  nobles  had  no  means  of  re-
pairing their  still  greater  losses.  For  the  prosperity  of  the
Florentine  people  was  so  prodigious  at  the  time  that,  even
after  this  wholesale  destruction,  their  riches  seemed  nowise
diminished.  But  there  was  a  notable  decline  in  the  power
of  the  magnates,  who  disappeared  almost  entirely  from
the  first  circuit,  or  centre  of  the  city,  where  the  old
families  had  their  dwellings.  Therefore  Capponi  has
some  reason  to  say  in  his  history  :  "  From  that  moment
the  supremacy  of  the  nobles  seems  to  have  been  uprooted,
and  new  social  orders  established."  ^  Thus,  as  always
happened  in  Florence,  even  this  great  calamity  proved
advantageous  to  the  people.

In  consequence  of  these  lamentable  events,  added  to
the  reports  sent  by  Cardinal  da  Prato  to  the  Pope  in
Perugia,  the  Holy  Father  cited  twelve  leading  magnates  of
Florence  to  appear  before  him  there.  Among  the  per-
sons thus  summoned  were  Corso  Donati  and  Rosso   della

Tosa,  once  bitter  enemies  but  now  friends  for  the  moment.
They  set  out  towards  Perugia  with  a  great  train  of  fol-
lowers, forming  a  mounted  company  of  five  hundred  men
in  all.  So  the  exiles  considered  this  a  most  favourable
opportunity  for  making  a  fresh  attempt  to  re-enter  their
native  city.  As  usual,  it  was  rumoured  that  the  Cardinal
had  encouraged  them  to  expect  a  good  reception  ;  and  it
was  further  announced  that  he  had  instigated  Pisa,  Bologna,
Arezzo,  Pistoia,  and  the  whole  of  Romagna  to  come  to
their  aid.  But  although  some  of  the  exiles'  direst  foes
were  absent  from  Florence  at  the  time,  on  the  other  hand,
the  position  of  their  adversaries  must  have  been  con-
siderably strengthened  by  the  slaughter  of  the  Cavakanti
and  Gherardini.  Likewise,  although  the  Greater  Guilds
had  once  been  induced  to  favour  the  return  of  banished
men,  and  particularly  those  of  the  popular  class,  it  was
not  to  be  expected  that  they  would  now  be  disposed  to
welcome  exiles  advancing  on  Florence  under  the  wing  of
the  Pisans,  and  joined  with  the  Ghibellines  of  Tuscany  and
Romagna.  This  league  with  the  enemies  of  the  State
naturally  roused  all  Florence  against  them.

Nevertheless  the  exiles  seemed  very  hopeful.  Thanks
to  their  new  allies,  they  had  contrived  to  collect  an  army
of  9,000  foot  and  1,600  horse,  and  on  the  19th  of  July
marched  into  Lastra,  to  await  other  reinforcements  from
Pistoia.  These  were  to  be  commanded  by  Tolosato  degli
Uberti,  a  valiant  Ghibelline  leader,  of  an  ancient  Florentine
house,  persistently  hated  by  the  Guelphs,  in  memory  of
the  rout  at  Montaperti.  As  Uberti  failed  to  appear,  the
exiles  resolved  to  move  on  without  him  ;  but  the  twenty-
four  hours'  delay  had  sufficed  to  destroy  their  chance  of
taking  Florence  by  surprise  In  fact,  only  twelve  hundred
horse  rode  to  the  city  in  peaceful  array,  bearing  olive
boughs  in  their  hands  ;  and  passing  the  unfinished  girdle
of  new  walls,  halted   beneath  the  old    bastions,  in    the


ATTEMPT  TO  RE-ENTER  FLORENCE,  535

Cafagglo  fields,  between  St.  Mark's  and  the  Church  of
the  Servi.  There,  on  the  20th  of  July,  panting  from
fatigue,  without  water,  and  exposed  to  the  burning  sun,
they  vainly  waited  for  the  gates  to  be  opened  to  them.
Meanwhile  a  small  band  of  their  men  had  managed  to
enter  the  city  by  forcing  the  Spadai  gate,  and  advanced  as
far  as  Piazza  San  Giovanni.  But  instead  of  finding  friends
there,  they  were  met  by  200  horse  and  500  foot,  who  drove
them  back,  capturing  some  of  their  number,  and  leaving  a
good  many  wounded  and  slain.  This  gave  the  signal  for
a  retreat,  soon  converted  into  a  general  flight.  The  force
waiting  at  Cafaggio,  exhausted  from  hunger  and  heat
combined,  had  already  thrown  down  their  weapons  and
dispersed  with  *'  bands  of  volunteers  "  in  pursuit.  Many
were  killed  or  died  of  fatigue,  others  were  stripped,  seized
and  strung  up  on  trees.  News  of  the  defeat  reached
Lastra  before  the  fugitives  returned  ;  accordingly  those
encamped  there  took  to  flight,  and  although  Tolosato
degli  Uberti  met  them  on  the  way,  he  found  it  impossible
to  rally  them  to  the  attack.  Among  other  narratives  of
the  affair  we  have  that  of  Villani,  who  witnessed  all  that
occurred  in  Florence.'  Dante  Alighieri  was  not  with  the
army  at  Lastra,  having  separated  from  his  companions  in
exile  shortly  before,  and  almost  in  anger.  He  was  pro-
bably disgusted  by  their  hybrid  alliance  with  all  the
enemies  of  Florence,  by  the  secret  agreements  set  on
foot  between  Donati  and  the  Cavalcanti,  and  saddened
by  the  internecine  slaughter  so  blindly  provoked  in  the
vain  expectation  of  compassing  the  recall  of  a  few  banished
men. 2

The  victory  at  Lastra  must  have  undoubtedly  augmented
the  daring  and  power  of  the  magnates.  It  may  have  been
on  this  account  that  certain  of  their  number  now  insisted
on  their  names  being  erased  from  the  rolls  of  the  guilds.  ^
Additional  proof  to  this  effect  is  furnished  by  another
important  event  occurring  on  the  5th  of  August,  1304.
One  of  the  Adimari  having  perpetrated  a  crime,  was
brought  before  the  Podesta  to  be  judged.  But  his
associates  made  a  violent  assault  on  that  magistrate  as  he
was  leaving  the  Priors'  palace,  and  after  wounding  or  kill-
ing several  of  his  escort,  broke  into  the  prison  and  rescued
the  criminal.  Thereupon  the  Captain  of  the  People,  Messer
Gigliolo  da  Prato,  temporarily  acting  as  Podesta  (since
the  continual  disturbances  in  the  city  had  deterred  every
one  from  assuming  that  office),  departed  from  Florence  in
high  indignation.  Accordingly,  to  provide  for  the  due
administration  of  justice,  the  Florentines  were  obliged  to
elect  a  committee  of  twelve  citizens,  one  noble  and  one
popolano^  from  every  Sesto,  to  fulfil  the  duties  of  a  Podesta. 2
Presently,  however,  the  resumption  of  hostilities  outside
the  walls  reduced  the  city  to  quiet  for  a  time.

The  exiles  had  again  begun  to  scour  the  land,  stirring
neighbouring  strongholds  to  revolt  ;   and  the  Florentines

frequently  repeated  between  1301  and  1304.

NOBLES  AND  EXILES  IN  REVOLT.  537

instantly  marched  against  them.  The  first  place  to  be
attacked  was  the  castle  of  Stinche,  which  had  been  incited
to  rebel  by  the  Cavalcanti.  Its  reduction  was  easily  effected
(August,  1304),  and  all  the  captives  were  lodged  in  the
new  prisons,  henceforth  entitled  the  "Stinche."  A  more
serious  expedition  had  to  be  undertaken  in  1305  against
Pistoia,  when  it  rose  to  arms  in  the  Bianchi  cause,  aided
by  Arezzo  and  Pisa,  and  under  the  command  of  Tolosato
degli  Uberti.  A  long  and  vigorous  siege  was  the  result.
The  beleaguering  force  of  Florentines  and  Lucchese  was
led  by  Duke  Robert  of  Calabria,  who,  as  Captain  of  the
League,  had  furnished  a  large  contingent  of  foot  and  300
Catalan  horse. ^  The  town  held  out  during  the  whole
winter,  but  in  April,  1306,  the  Pistoiese  were  compelled
to  surrender  from  famine.  Their  walls  and  towers  were
demolished,  their  territory  divided  between  the  Florentines
and  Lucchese.  Pope  Clement  V.  had  vainly  endeavoured
to  put  an  end  to  this  war  which  dealt  another  cruel  blow
to  the  Tuscan  Ghibellines.  He  was  a  native  of  P'rance,
had  transferred  the  papal  see  to  Avignon,  and  had  no
knowledge  of  Italy.  Nor  could  Italy  feel  any  love  for
an  alien  Pope  who  had  deserted  Rome.  In  fact,  the
Florentines  declined  to  listen  to  the  messengers  of  peace
he  despatched  to  their  camp,  and  paid  no  heed  to  the
interdict  he  launched  against  them.  For  although  the
Duke  of  Calabria  withdrew,  this  was  only  a  feint,  seeing
that  he  left  them  all  his  men  under  the  command  ot
Captain  Pietro  de  la  Rat.  So  the  campaign  was  carried
on  to  the  end.

Nor  did  the  other  envoy  of  peace.  Cardinal  Napoleon
Orsini,  meet  with  any  better  fortune,  for  he  was  not  only
ill  received  in  Tuscany  and  Romagna,  but  robbed  of  his
goods  and  even  in  danger  of  his  life.     As  for  his  excom-

'  These  Catalans,  after  fighting  the  Moors  in  Spain,  scattered  to  different
parts  of  the  world,  and  refused  to  return  to  their  own  country.


538       FLORENTINE  EXILES  AND  HENRY  VIL

munications,  interdicts,  and  counsels  of  peace,  every  one
laughed  at  them.  The  Florentines  were  determined  to
do  the  work  thoroughly,  and  even  before  the  conclusion
of  the  war  with  Pistoia,  started  another  expedition  against
the  formidable  castle  of  Montaccenico,  chief  stronghold  of
the  Ubaldini,  dominating  the  whole  of  the  Mugello  and
serving  as  the  exiles'  headquarters.  By  dint  of  scattering
bribes  among  the  Ubaldini  themselves,  the  Florentines
finally  won  the  castle  by  treason,  and,  after  reducing  it  to
ruin,  immediately  resolved  to  plant  the  towns  of  Scarperia
and  Firenzuola  in  its  vicinity,  *'  to  serve  as  scarecrows  to
the  Ubaldini,  and  harbours  of  refuge  to  faithful  subjects."
All  willing  to  inhabit  the  little  town  founded  for  that
purpose,  were  to  be  exempt  from  every  form  of  vassalage.
The  first  stone  of  Scarperia  was  laid,  without  delay,  on
the  7th  of  September,  1307  ;  but  the  construction  of
Firenzuola  was  postponed  to  a  much  later  date  (1332).

We  must  now  consider  what  was  the  object  the  Republic
had  in  view,  and  what  it  achieved  by  means  of  these  continual
campaigns,  in  which  even  the  magnates  took  a  part ;  what
too  by  the  reduction  of  Ghibelline  cities,  and  the  destruction
of  castles  throughout  the  whole  territory .''  On  the  one
hand,  its  political  predominance  in  Tuscany  was  rapidly
increased,  and  new  outlets  of  commerce  acquired  ;  while,
on  the  other,  the  power  of  the  magnates  outside  Florence
was  overthrown  by  the  aid  of  those  within  the  walls,  who,
in  their  blind  fury  against  the  exiles,  did  not  realise  what
they  were  doing.  The  Florentines  of  old  had  demolished
the  castles,  which  at  one  time  reached  nearly  to  their  gates ;
they  had  forced  the  barons  to  dwell  in  the  city,  had  sub-
jected them  to  republican  laws,  and  lowered  their  pride
by  excluding  them  from  the  government.  Profiting  by
their  disputes,  the  citizens  had  next  spurred  them  to
destroy  one  another  ;  and,  in  conclusion,  were  now  making
them    turn    their  weapons  against  more   distant    nobles,


MOTIVE  OF  THE  REPUBLIC'S  HOSTILITIES.  539

and  overthrow  the  latter's  strongholds  in  the  Casentino,
Mugello,  and  valley  of  the  Arno.  All  this  was  invariably-
advantageous  to  the  guilds  and  the  people.  Therefore,
in  1306,  while  the  Pistoian  campaign  was  still  going  on,
the  Florentines  reorganised  citizen-armed  bands  under
nineteen  Gonfalonieri.  This  was  the  constitution  of  "the
good  Guelph  people,"  a  reform  made,  according  to
Villani,  "  in  order  to  prevent  the  '  Grandi '  and  other
powerful  folk  from  presuming  to  show  arrogance  on
the  strength  of  having  gained  many  victories  over  the
Bianchi  and  Ghibellines."  ^

But  this  was  not  all,  for  the  real  gist  of  the  new
reform  consisted  in  the  law  of  the  23rd  of  December,
1306,  by  which  the  enactments  were  strengthened  and
an  Executor  of  Justice  was  appointed  to  enforce  their
more  rigorous  application.  The  object  of  the  law  was
clearly  expressed  by  the  introductory  words  explaining
that  it  was  intended  "  to  preserve  the  liberties  of  the
Florentine  people,  and  break  the  pride  of  iniquitous  men,
which  has  swollen  to  such  extent  that  our  eyes  fail  to
discern  its  limits."

In  point  of  fact,  the  guilds  showed  no  mercy  to
the  magnates,  even  when  fighting  side  by  side  with
them  against  common  foes.  The  "  Executor "  was
required  to  be  a  Guelph,  a  man  of  the  people,  and  a
foreigner,  i.e.^  of  non-Tuscan  birth,  from  some  city  or
place,  subject  to  no  lord,  and  not  less  than  eighty  miles
from  Florence.  He  was  neither  to  be  a  knight  nor  a
law  judge,  a  prohibition  caused  by  the  growing  hatred
against  perverse  judges  and  fatal  experience  of  recent
Podestas.  The  "  Executor  "  was  to  remain  in  office  for
six  months,  and  he  was  to  bring  with  him  one  judge,  two
notaries,  twenty  masnadieri,  or  guards — all  of  whom  were
to  be  Guelphs  and  aliens — and  two  war-horses.    His  office

•  Villani,  viii.  87.


S40       FLORENTINE  EXILES  AND  HENRY  VI I.

was  to  protect  the  people  and  all  the  weak  against  power-
ful personages,  and  to  call  the  companies  to  arms  when-
ever any  crime  should  be  committed,  for  the  prompt
enforcement  of  the  penalties  prescribed.  It  was  to  be
his  special  duty  to  ensure  the  due  execution  of  the
Enactments  of  Justice,  and  whenever  the  Podesta  or
Captain  failed  to  do  their  part,  he  was  instantly  to
assume  their  functions  according  to  the  rules  minutely
laid  down  in  the  new  lav/,  that  was  henceforth  an
integral  portion  of  the  enactments.^  He  was  likewise
to  deal  punishment  on  all  frauds  and  dishonest  tricks
practised  in  the  offices  of  the  Commune.  Should  the
Podesta  fail  to  demolish  buildings  (churches  always
excepted)  in  which  conventicles  or  meetings  had  been
illegally  held,  he  was  to  enforce  the  said  demolition,  and
impose  a  fine  of  500  lire  on  the  Podesta.  Capital
punishment  was  to  be  inflicted  on  all  who  held  meet-
ings, to  plot  treason  against  liberty  or  the  popular
government.  In  such  case,  if  nobles  were  concerned  the
penalty  was  to  be  adjudged  by  the  Podesta,  and  should
the  Podesta  hesitate  to  act,  the  Executor  was  to  mulct
him  as  usual,  and  assume  his  functions.  When  the  guilty
were  popolani  the  Executor  alone  was  to  condemn  them
to  death  and  degrade  their  descendants  to  the  rank  of
nobles.  Likewise  all  popolani  accessory  to  crimes  per-
petrated by  nobles  were  to  be  condemned  by  the  Executor
to  double  the  penalty  prescribed  by  the  common  law.
It  was  also  the  Executor's  task  to  examine  the  actions  of
the  outgoing  Podesta  and  Captain,  and  he,  in  due  turn,
was  subjected  to  investigation  by  persons  appointed  by
the  Priors  and  Gonfaloniers  of  the  Companies.^

THE  EXECUTOR  OF  JUSTICE.  541


VI.

Meanwhile  the  Pope's  anxiety  being  stirred  by  the
increasing  agitation  provoked  by  the  Florentine  exiles,
throughout  Romagna  and  the  Marches,  as  well  as  in
Tuscany,  again  began  to  insist  upon  peace.  But  the
person  charged  to  open  negotiations  to  this  effect  was
Cardinal  Orsini,  a  man  of  strong  party  feeling  and
doubtful  integrity.  For  when  at  Arezzo  in  1307,  he
had  called  there,  in  addition  to  the  Florentine  exiles,
many  adherents  of  his  own  from  the  adjoining  States  of
the  Church,  thus  assembling  a  force  of  1,700  cavalry
and  a  great  number  of  foot  soldiers.  It  appears  that  he
had  come  to  terms  with  Corso  Donati  and  received
money  from  him  for  the  undertaking  in  view.  Messer
Corso,  whose  ambition  was  still  unassuaged,  had  married
a  third  time,  and  was  now  related,  through  his  wife,  with
the  Ghibelline  lord,  Uguccione  della  Faggiuola.  This
circumstance  naturally  exposed  him  to  much  suspicion  on
the  part  of  the  Guelphs,  and  accordingly,  being  even
more  angered  and  discontented  than  before,  he  was  again
bitterly  hostile  to  Messer  Rosso  della  Tosa  and  his
followers,  who  in  their  turn,  and  as  an  inevitable  conse-
quence, had  again  combined  with  the  wealthier  burghers.
Hence,  the  latter,  on  noting  the  Cardinal's  preparations,
and  Donati's  new  manceuvres,  speedily  collected  an  army  of
3,000  horse  and  15,000  foot,  and  without  further  hesita-
tion marched  towards  Arezzo,  ravaging  the  enemies'
lands  by  the  way.  Thereupon,  by  way  of  displaying
his  military  tactics,  the  Cardinal  directed  his  march  on
Florence  through  the  Casentino.  But  as  the  Florentines
outwitted  him,  by  doubling  back  and  reaching  the  city
before  him,  he  was  obliged  to  retreat  to  Arezzo  in  a
very    crestfallen    mood.      He  then    opened    negotiations


542       FLORENTINE  EXILES  AND  HENRY  VIL

with  the  Florentines,  who,  feigning  willingness  to
entertain  his  proposals,  despatched  two  ambassadors  to
gull  him  with  fair  words.  Compagni  remarks  that  "  no
woman  was  ever  more  flattered  and  then  abused  by
betrayers  than  he  (the  Cardinal)  by  those  two  knights."  ^
So  that  all  he  could  do  was  to  go  off  with  his  tail  between
his  legs,  once  more  leaving  the  city  under  sentence  of
excommunication.2  In  revenge  for  this,  the  Florentines
imposed  fresh  taxes  on  the  clergy,  punishing  those  who
refused  to  pay. 3

The  worst  sufferer  was  Corso  Donati,  for  the  Cardinal,
after  extracting  money  from  him  by  promising  to  come
to  Florence  to  crush  Delia  Tosa  and  his  Black  faction,
had  not  even  dared  to  approach  the  walls.  But  without
acknowledging  his  defeat,  Donati  immediately  plunged
into  fresh  and  more  daring  schemes.  After  a  short
absence  from  Florence,  probably  to  gain  funds  and
allies,  he  returned  there  in  1308.  Increasingly  blinded
by  party  passion,  counting  on  assistance  from  his  father-
in-law,  Uguccione  della  Faggiuola,  now  lord  of  Arezzo,
as  well  as  from  Prato  and  Pistoia,  he  called  a  meeting
of  his  adherents  in  Florence.  After  explaining  his  hopes
and  vowing  to  do  away  with  the  Enactments  of  Justice,
he  urged  them  to  draw  their  swords  and  make  an  end
of  those  Neri,  who,  after  receiving  so  much  help  from
him  and  gaining  victory  by  his  means,  now  treated  him
so  iniquitously.  But  the  rumour  being  already  abroad
that  he  expected  aid  from  that  bitterest  foe  of  Florence
— the  formidable  Uguccione — the  popular  feeling  against
him  was  excited  to  the  highest  pitch.4  After  being
repressed  for  some  time  the  general  fury  burst  out  all
at  once,  and  took  Donati  unawares.  Suddenly,  on  the
6th  of  October,   1308,  the  Signory  sounded  the  alarm-

bell,  and  the  people,  rising  to  arms,  united  with  the  Delia

Tosa  faction,  other  friendly  magnates,  and  De  la   Rat's

Catalan  troops.     Donati  was  denounced  to  the  Podesta,

Piero  della  Branca  of  Gubbio,  as  a  traitor  to  his  country,

and   in   less   than    an    hour   he  was  accused,  tried,   and

condemned.    Immediately  afterwards,  the  Signory,  Podesta,

Captain,    and    Executor,  with  their  respective   familiars,

the  Catalan   troops,   knights,    and  citizen-trained   bands,

marched   to  St.  Piero    Maggiore  to    attack    the    Donati

houses.     But  Messer   Corso  and  his  friends  resisted    so

valiantly,   that   had  Uguccione  and    the   others    fulfilled

their  promise  of  coming  to  the  rescue  in  time,  the  affair

might  have  taken  an  ugly  turn.     It  is  supposed  that  the

Aretines  were  already  on  the  march,  when,  hearing  that

all   Florence  had  risen  against  Donati,  they   decided  to

turn  back.     At  all  events,  no  succour  arrived,  and  Messer

Corso   soon    found   that   even    many    of  his    Florentine

friends  had  ceased  to  defend  the  chain  barricades,  and

relinquished  the  struggle.     Thereupon  the  people  broke

through,   and  soon   demolished  the  houses  he   had  been

forced    to   abandon.      Accompanied    by    a   few   devoted

adherents,  he  fled  from  the  town  by  the  Croce  gate,  with

the  citizens  and  Catalans  in  hot  pursuit.     The  first  man

captured  on   the  banks  of  the  Africo  was  Gherardo  dei

Bordoni,  who  was  instantly  slain.     Next,  the  crowd   cut

off  his  hand  and  nailed  it  on  the  door  of  the  Adimari

house,  because  Tedici  degli  Adimari  had  first  instigated

the  dead  man  to  join  with  Donati.     A  few  moments  later

the  Catalans  overtook  Donati  himself  at  San  Salvi,  and

in  obedience  to  orders  killed  him  on  the  spot.     According

to  another  version  of  the  tale,  he  first  tried  to  bribe  them

to  spare  his  life,  but  without  success;  so,  to  avoid  falling

into  the  hands  of  his   Florentine   foes,   he   cast   himself

on  the  ground  and  was  dispatched  by  a  spear-thrust   in

the  throat.     The  monks  of  San  Salvi  bore  away  his  dead


544       FLORENTINE  EXILES  AND  HENRY  VIL

body,  and  the  following  day  buried  him  in  the
Badia  without  any  pomp  for  fear  of  provoking  the
public  wrath.  ^

The  cause  of  this  sudden  and  irresistible  burst  of
popular  fury  is  clearly  explained  by  the  letters  which  the
Commune  shortly  addressed  to  the  Lucchese,  in  whose
territory  the  Bordoni  had  found  refuge.  "  It  is  known
to  all  Tuscany  that  the  Donati  had  planned  a  war  to  the
death,  in  order  to  give  the  city  of  Florence  and  the
Guelph  party  into  the  hands  of  the  Ghibellines,  and  sub-
ject to  their  yoke,  to  the  utter  extermination  and  destruc-
tion of  the  Guelph  Government.  Those  rebels  intended
to  break  all  bounds,  and  subdue  the  city  to  their  rule,
although  Messer  Corso  and  his  followers  shamelessly
styled  the  Signory  Ghibelline  instead. "^  These  words
were  written  by  the  Signory  in  March,  1309.  In  fact,
the  Neri  being  split  into  Donati  and  Tosinghi  factions,
and  the  latter  having  united  with  the  wealthier  burghers,
from  whom  could  the  Donati  hope  assistance,  save  from
the  Ghibellines }  The  lower  class  of  the  people  was
weak,  and  the  distant  Pope  increasingly  urged  the  return
of  the  exiles.  The  latter  had  now  combined  with  Donati's
whilom  allies,  the  nobles  of  the  contado^  standing  aloof
from  many  of  the  burgher  Bianchi,  who  had  been  expelled  at
the  same  moment,  but  were  gradually  permitted  to  return  ;
and  they  had  also  separated  from  all  independent  men,
such  as  Dante  Alighieri.  The  poet,  in  fact,  being  opposed
to  Donati,  and  a  promoter  of  the  Enactments  of  Justice,  had
been  finally  driven  to  adopt  an  individual  attitude.     Thus

Prof.  Del  Lungo,  the  editor  of  these  documents,  does  not  believe  that
Corso  was  favourable  at  that  time  to  the  exiles  and  Ghibellines.  Besides,
the  latter  were  no  longer  the  genuine  Ghibellines  of  older  days.  There-
fore the  Signory  could  have  no  motive  for  deceiving  their  friends,  the
Lucchese,  and  their  letters  are  likewise  corroborated  by  the  previous
events  we  have  described.


NE  W  POSITION  OF  AFFAIRS.  545

the  Bianchi,  though  exiled  for  having  sided  with  the  people,
were  now  on  the  side  of  the  magnates,  the  Ghibellines,
Uguccione,  and  even  of  Corso  Donati,  the  only  person
likely  to  profit  by  so  hybrid  an  alliance.  Accordingly  his
death  had  the  immediate  result  of  giving  another  terrible
shock  to  the  magnates'  power,  both  within  and  without
the  city.  Speedy  proof  was  afforded  of  this  when,  at  the
beginning  of  1309,  the  proud  Ubaldini  came  to  make
submission  to  the  Florentine  Commune,  promising  to
guard  the  passes  of  the  Apennines,  and  supporting  their
offer  by  fitting  guarantees  of  good  faith.  In  consequence
of  this  they  were  accepted  as  friends,  with  the  condition,
"  that  in  every  act  and  deed  they  should  behave  as  good
subjects  and  citizens."^

Throughout  the  whole  of  its  history  the  Florentine
Commune  invariably  adopted  this  plan  when  admitting
nobles  to  its  midst.  But  it  had  also  the  effect  of  enabling
conquered  and  subject  magnates  to  gain  increased  strength
in  the  city  itself.  Therefore,  first  without  and  then
within  the  walls,  they  unceasingly  combated  the  people
and  the  Republic,  down  to  the  distant  time  when  they
were  finally  crushed  by  the  State.  If  Florentine  pros-
perity as  yet  showed  no  signs  of  diminution  during  the
sanguinary  struggle  now  described,  it  was  for  two  reasons
which  should  be  duly  kept  in  mind.  The  successive  con-
flicts we  have  narrated,  all  proceeded  from  the  constant
necessity  of  preserving  the  merchant-republic  from  the
impact  of  the  extraneous  feudal  body  threatening  to  check
its  natural  growth.  These  civil  wars,  however,  were
carried  by  a  comparatively  small  number  of  citizens,
eager  to  gain  possession  of  a  government  that  had  far
less  influence  on  society  than  is  generally  supposed.  The
true   motive-power  of  the  Republic  proceeded  less  from

the  Signory,  which  was  changed  every  two  months,  than
from  the  commercial  and  political  constitution  of  the
guilds,  which  were  firmly  organised  and,  so  far,  thoroughly
in  unison.  The  conditions  of  an  all-absorbing  modern
State,  wherein  every  shock  affects  society  at  large,  had
not  yet  sprung  to  life  in  the  Middle  Ages.  The
Italian  republics  were  miniature  confederacies  of  separate
associations,  under  a  central  government  of  so  feeble  a
kind,  that  even  when  totally  suppressed  for  a  time,  no
great  harm  seemed  to  result  from  its  loss.


VII.  ,

Corso  Donati's  death  put  an  end  to  the  tragedy  of
which  the  expulsion  of  the  Bianchi  had  formed  the  first
act  ;  and  now  the  condition  of  all  Italy,  as  well  as  Florence,
was  changed  by  a  new  event.  This  was  the  murder  of
Albert  of  Hapsburg  by  his  nephew,  on  the  ist  of  May,
1308.  Therefore  the  election  of  a  new  king  of  the
Romans  and  future  emperor  was  now  imminent.  Philip
the  Beautiful  aspired  to  win  the  Imperial  crown,  if  not  for
himself,  at  least  for  his  brother,  Charles  of  Valois,  through
the  help  of  Clement  V.  As  the  Pope  was  residing  in
France,  he  could  not  directly  oppose  the  design,  but
had  certainly  no  intention  of  favouring  it.  With  the
Angevins  at  Naples,  the  Holy  See  transferred  to  Avignon,
and  Rome  in  revolt  against  him,  the  choice  of  a  French
emperor  would  have  placed  him  entirely  at  Philip's  mercy.
Accordingly  he  gave  secret  support  to  Henry  of  Luxem-
bourg, who  was  elected  to  the  throne  as  Henry  VII.  on
the  27th  of  November,  1308.  This  emperor,  born  on
the  French  frontier,  and  educated  in  France,  presented  a
combination  of  Germanic  and  Latin  characteristics.  As  lord
of  a  petty  State,  he  had  no  real  strength  or  power  of  his


ELECTION  OF  EMPEROR  HENRY  VII.         547

own  ;  but  having  great  nobility  of  mind  and  an  imagination
disposed  to  mysticism,  he  had  formed  a  lofty  idea  of  the
dignity  and  might  of  the  universal  Empire  that  he  hoped
to  restore  to  Rome.  He  seemed  totally  unable  to  com-
j-irehend  that  the  feudal  union  of  Germany  and  Italy,
vvhich  had  missed  success  even  at  the  beginning  of  the
Middle  Ages,  had  become  totally  impossible  now  that
feudalism  itself,  the  principal  basis  of  the  Holy  Roman
Empire,  was  almost  annihilated  in  Italy.  Nevertheless,
when  Henry  first  raised  the  Imperial  flag,  enormous  hopes
were  conceived  by  the  Ghibellines,  and  rapidly  spread
throughout  the  peninsula.  All  men  seemed  to  be  sud-
denly stirred  to  genuine  enthusiasm.

The  Ghibellines  of  that  day  were  no  longer  the
Ghibellines  of  old,  and  in  Italy  the  conception  of  the
Empire  had  undergone  a  total  change.  The  hostile
attitude  of  the  Popes  towards  republican  freedom  and
independence  ;  their  persistent  struggle  against  the  Roman
Commune  ;  the  fact  of  Clement  V.  being  at  a  distance,
in  France,  and  weakly  dependent  on  the  French  monarch ;
the  necessity,  now  beginning  to  be  generally  recognised,
of  building  up,  from  the  ruins  of  old  municipalities,  new
forms  of  government,  such  as  were  now  arising  in  France
and  elsewhere  ;  the  revival  of  classical  studies,  enabling
men  to  glean  from  the  Republic  and  Empire  of  ancient
Rome  some  literary  conception  of  the  unity  and  strength
of  the  secular  State  required  to  meet  present  needs  ; — had
all  combined  to  transform  the  mediasval  idea  of  the
Empire.  For  now  that  France  and  other  countries  were
detached  from  it,  the  Empire  was  no  longer  universal,  but
simply  Germanico-Roman  ;  while  to  ItaHan  eyes  it  was
beginning,  though  still  very  vaguely,  to  seem  a  revival  of
the  old  Rome  that  had  always  been  the  spiritual  head  of
the  civilised  world,  and  the  possible  centre  of  an  Italian
confederated  State.     This  idea  was  clearly  expressed  for


548       FLORENTINE  EXILES  AND  HENRY  VIL

the  first  time  in  Dante's  "  Monarchia,"  which  then  served
as  the  manifesto  of  the  Ghibelline  party.  The  same  idea
was  afterwards  more  widely  developed  in  the  "  Defensor
Pacis  "  of  Marsilio  da  Padova,  and  at  a  subsequent  date
inspired  the  fantastic  enthusiasm  of  Cola  di  Rienzo.  The
latter's  attempt — so  lauded  by  Petrarch — to  create  a  new
Roman,  Italian,  Imperial  Republic  was  a  confused  dream
of  scholastic,  classico-humanistic,  feudal,  and  mediaeval
ideas,  but  nevertheless  a  dream  containing  in  embryo
some  vague  conception  of  the  future  Italian  State  as  it
was  already  dimly  foreseen,  although  with  no  compre-
hension of  its  real  nature.  Such  as  it  was,  however,  this
incoherent  jumble  of  ideas  became  the  standard  of  the
Italian  Ghibellines.

The  Guelphs  had  no  philosophical  programme  of  their
own  to  flaunt  in  return.  The  force  of  events,  and  the
pressing  need  of  maintaining  the  independence  of  Italian
cities  against  Pope  and  emperor,  was  then  the  war-cry
of  the  Florentine  Guelphs.  To  Florence,  the  coming  of
the  emperor  signified  the  revival  of  the  old  Ghibelline
party,  consequently  the  revival  of  Arezzo,  Pistoia,  Pisa,
and  other  hostile  cities,  all  ready  to  compress  her  within
a  circle  of  steel,  and  strangle  her  commerce.  For  this
reason  she  called  on  the  Guelph  cities,  and  all  seeking
to  preserve  freedom  and  escape  foreign  tyranny,  to  join
in  an  Italian  confederation,  with  herself  at  its  head.  It
was,  therefore,  at  this  moment  that  the  small  merchant-
republic  initiated  a  true  national  policy,  and  became  a
great  power  in  Italy.  So,  in  the  mediasval  shape  of  a
feudal  and  universal  Empire,  on  the  one  hand,  and  in
that  of  a  municipal  confederation  on  the  other,  a  gleam
of  the  national  idea  first  began  to  appear,  though  still  in
the  far  distance  and  veiled  in  clouds.  Both  sides  fought
eagerly  for  the  interests  of  the  moment,  and  both  were
inspired  with  the  presentiment  of  a  new  future  ;  but  neither


FIRST  DA  \VN  OF  THE  NATIONAL  IDEA.      549

discerned  that  this  future  was  only  to  be  attained  by  the
destruction  of  both  parties  alike.

At  this  juncture  the  Pope  seemed  favourable  to
Henry  VII.,  for  he  encouraged  his  project  of  going  to
Rome  to  assume  the  Imperial  crown,  and  urged  the
Italians  to  accord  him  a  good  reception.  Nevertheless —
as  the  Florentines  had  known  from  the  first — he  could
not  wish  to  see  Italy  subject  to  the  Empire,  having  too
keen  a  remembrance  of  all  that  the  Church  had  endured
at  the  hands  of  Frederic  II.  Following,  therefore,  the
traditional  policy  of  the  Roman  Court,  he  simultaneously
encouraged  Robert  of  Naples,  formerly  Duke  of  Calabria,
who,  having  succeeded  to  the  throne  at  the  death  of  King
Charles  II.  (May  3,  1309),  was  naturally  prepared  to
resist  Henry's  pretensions  to  the  utmost.  At  first  the
Florentines  appeared  disposed  to  be  passive  lookers  on,
but  were  not  deceived  by  the  Pope's  pretence  of  en-
couraging Emperor  Henry.  They  desired  a  closer  alli-
ance with  Clement,  but  he  too  was  very  resentful  with
regard  to  their  past  conduct,  and  with  some  reason,
secretly  echoed  the  words  of  Benedict  XI.  :  "Who
could  imagine  that  those  men  "  (the  Florentines)  "  should
presume  to  be  sons  of  the  Church,  while  fighting  against
her }  "  But  nowise  dismayed  by  this,  they  treated  with
King  Robert,  who  still  allowed  them  to  retain  the  services
of  Captain  De  la  Rat  and  his  Catalan  horse,  and  now
sent  them  his  flag  in  addition.  With  the  help  of  this
contingent  the  Florentines  made  repeated  attacks  on
Arezzo,  refusing  to  desist  even  when  Henry  warned
them  to  respect  that  city  as  a  fief  of  the  Empire.  Their
attacks  were  invariably  successful,  and  they  even  forced
their  way  into  the  town,  but  were  prevented  from  holding
it  by  the  treachery  of  the  magnates,  as  it  was  rumoured
at    the  time.'     All   acts    and    decrees  of   the  Commune

bore  the  heading  :  "  In  honour  of  Holy  Church  and  His
Majesty  King  Robert,  and  to  the  defeat  of  the  German
king.'


"I


VIII.

In  1 310  Henry  set  out  for  Italy,  leaving  the  affairs  of
Germany  to  his  son's  care.  Louis  of  Savoy,  the  newly
elected  Senator  of  Rome,  was  sent  on  in  advance,  and
reached  Florence  on  the  3rd  of  July,  accompanied  by
two  German  prelates.  The  latter  were  admitted  to  the
council  ;  but  in  answer  to  their  request  that  Florence
should  prepare  to  receive  the  emperor  with  due  honour,
Betto  Brunelleschi  replied  :  "  That  the  Florentines  had
never  lowered  their  horns  before  any  lord  whatsoever  ;  "
and  this  somewhat  indecorous  response  was  sufficiently
indicative  of  the  public  feeling.  In  fact,  the  Imperial
envoys,  though  everywhere  well  received,  obtained  nothing
from  Florence,  and  even  failed  to  put  a  stop  to  the
war  with  Arezzo.  And  when  ambassadors  from  nearly
every  city  of  Italy  sought  audience  of  Henry  at  Lausanne,
no  Florentine  envoys  appeared.  On  the  contrary,  Flor-
ence was  energetically  preparing  for  defence  ;  the  new
walls  were  raised  about  sixteen  feet  higher,  and  surrounded
by  moats  from  the  Prato  gate  to  that  of  San  Gallo,  and
thence  to  the  Arno.'^  On  the  30th  of  September  Robert
arrived  in  Florence  from  Avignon,  where  the  Pope  had
crowned  him  King  of  Naples,  and  likewise  appointed
him  Vicar  of  Romagna,  to  prevent  Henry  from  seizing
that  province  which  had  recently  seceded  from  the
Empire.  King  Robert  soon  came  to  an  understanding
with  the  Florentines,  and  arranged  measures  with  them
for  their  common  defence.  Notwithstanding  this,  Henry
continued  to  advance,  heading  all  his   decrees  with   the

THE  EMPEROR  CROSSES  THE  ALPS.  551

phrase,  in  nomine  regis  pacijici,  and  assuming  the  part  of
a  just  and  impartial  judge.  He  summoned  both  Guelphs
and  Ghibellines  to  his  side,  promising  equal  welcome  to
all.  He  reached  Susa  by  the  24th  of  October,  and  on
the  Feast  of  the  Epiphany  (January  6,  131 1)  assumed
the  Iron  Crown  in  the  Church  of  St.  Ambrogio  at
iViilan.

But  in  this  city  his  dream  of  peace  was  disturbed  by  a
sudden  outburst  of  civil  war.  The  Guelph  Torriani  were
expelled  by  the  Visconti  before  his  eyes  ;  and  from  that
moment,  being  forcibly  dragged  into  the  vortex  of  party
strife,  Henry  renounced  his  mission  as  peacemaker,  and
was  again  a  German,  foreign,  and  barbarian  emperor.
It  was  averred  that  the  Florentines  had  bribed  Guido
della  Torre  to  raise  a  rebellion,  and  that  this  was  the
cause  of  his  expulsion.  We  have  no  certainty  that  this
was  the  case,  but  it  is  an  ascertained  fact  that  they  sent
money,  despatches,  and  envoys  to  Cremona,  Lodi,  Brescia,
Pavia,  and  other  Lombard  cities,  and  succeeded  in  stirring
them  to  rise  against  Henry. '  They  also  sent  ambas-
sadors to  Naples,  France,  and  more  particularly  to
Avignon,  where  they  lavished  heavy  bribes  on  the  officials
of  the  Curia,  for  the  purpose  of  learning  when  the  Pope
spoke  truly  or  falsely.  On  all  sides  they  displayed  such
feverish  activity  that  one  day  the  Cardinal  da  Prato  ex-
claimed in  the  presence  of  the  French  king  :  "  How  great
is  the  insolence  of  these  Florentines  in  daring  to  tempt
every  lord  with  their  lousy  small  coin  !  "-

Even  in  crises  such  as  these  the  magnates  of  Florence
could  not  lay  aside  their  animosities,  but  continued  to
disturb  the  city  by  fresh  riots  now  and  then.  In  Feb-
ruary, 131 1,  the  Donati  murdered  Betto  Brunelleschi,
whom  they  considered  responsible  for  Messer  Corso's
death,  and  immediately  afterwards  disinterred  the  latter's
'  Villani,  ix.  11.  '  Compagni,  iii.  32,


552       FLORENTINE  EXILES  AND  HENRY  VIL  'i


corpse  at  San  Salvi,  and  reburied  him  with  due  pomp  now
that  he  had  been  avenged.*

Nevertheless,  order  was  quickly  restored,  since  there
was  little  leisure  for  private  feuds,  and  men's  minds  v/ere
absorbed  in  graver  concerns.  At  the  beginning  of  June,
131 1,  Florence,  Pisa,  Lucca,  Sienna,  and  Volterra  gave
their  formal  adherence  to  the  Guelph  League,  and  swore
to  combine  in  armed  defence  against  Henry.  On  the
26th  of  June,  the  Florentines  despatched  De  la  Rat  to
Bologna  with  400  Catalan  horse,  while  the  Siennese  and
Lucchese  forwarded  another  contingent  to  King  Robert
in  Romagna,  where  that  monarch  was  harrying  and  in-
carcerating all  the  Ghibellines  and  exiled  Florentine
Bianchi  who  were  then  trying  to  stir  the  Papal  cities  to
revolt.2  And  when  it  was  rumoured  that  the  king  was
seeking  to  make  terms  with  Henry,  the  Florentines  wrote
to  him,  insisting  on  his  entering  Rome  at  once,  according
to  his  promise,  and  likewise  warning  him  that  they
would  stand  no  half-measures,  and  that  if  he  delayed,  or
attempted  any  pact  with  the  emperor,  they  would  instantly
withdraw  their  forces  from  the  League.  "Inasmuch  as
your  Royal  Majesty  has  repeatedly  promised  us  to  make
no  terms  with  the  German  king,  but  to  supply  us  with
an  armed  force  and  go  in  person  to  Rome  to  exterminate
our  common  foe. "3  This  missive  had  some  effect,  for
Robert  speedily  despatched  400  horse  to  Rome  under
his  brother  John,  who,  with  the  help  of  the  Orsini,  soon
won  the  chief  vantage-points  of  the  city.  The  king  still
feigned  to  act  in  the  interests  of  the  Empire ;  but  no  one
was  deceived  by  this  pretence,  and  the  Florentines  were
satisfied.

Meanwhile  Henry,  still  faithful  to  his  original   plan,

and  quite  unconscious  of  the  extraordinary  change  that
was  going  on,  had  reduced  Cremona  to  submission,  and
was  now  besieging  Brescia,  which  opposed  a  more  stub-
born resistance.  The  "peaceful"  monarch  vented  his
rage  on  his  prisoners  and  put  one  of  the  Guelph  leaders
to  a  most  atrociously  cruel  death.  But  the  Brescians  still
refused  to  surrender ;  the  flower  of  the  German  army
was  perishing  from  sickness  and  wounds,  and  Henry's
brother  died  of  his  hurts.  During  these  days  of  slaughter,
Florence  wrote  to  the  Brescians,  saying,  "Remember  that
the  safety  of  all  Italy  and  all  Guelphs  depends  on  your
resistance.  The  Latins  must  always  hold  the  Germans
in  enmity,  seeing  that  they  are  opposed  in  act  and  deed,
in  manners  and  soul ;  not  only  is  it  impossible  to  serve,
but  even  to  hold  any  intercourse  with  that  race."'  At
the  same  time  they  wrote  to  encourage  other  cities  to
make  a  stand  and  rise  to  arms.  They  summoned  the
Perugians  "to  shake  off  their  bonds  of  vassalage,  and
proclaim  the  sweets  of  liberty";  repeating  to  all  that,
for  their  own  part,  they  would  unceasingly  devote  their
arms,  men,  and  gold  to  the  task  of  resistance. 2  Also,  for
the  greater  reinforcement  of  the  citizens  and  the  Guelph
party,  they  removed  the  ban  from  all  exiles,  probably
well  disposed  to  the  Guelphs,  only  maintaining  it  against
several  hundred  supposed  Ghibellines,  Dante  Alighieri
among  the  number.  This  modification  of  the  Law  of
Banishment  was  known  as  the  Amendment  of  Baldo
d'Aguglione,  one  of  the  Priors  by  whom  it  was  passed  on
September  2,  131 1.'

Meanwhile,  after  an  heroic  defence,  Brescia  was  forced
to  accept  terms  of  surrender,  whereupon  Henry  immedi-

ately  set  out  towards  Genoa,  entering  that  city  on
October  21,  131 1.  Here,  though  deeply  grieved  by  the
death  of  his  wife,  he  allowed  no  delay  in  the  necessary
preparations  for  continuing  his  journey  to  Rome  by  the
Pisan  route.  And,  being  informed  of  this,  the  Floren-
tines redoubled  their  efforts.  They  strengthened  the
garrison  of  San  Miniato  al  Tedesco,  recalled  from  Bologna
De  la  Rat  and  his  troops,  despatched  reinforcements
to  Lucca,  Sarzana,  Pietrasanta,  and  the  fortresses  in  Luni-
giana,  and  the  western  Valdarno.'  But  remarkable  as  it
may  seem,  they  never  neglected  the  interests  of  their
trade,  even  at  this  critical  time.  In  fact,  they  chose  this
moment  to  address  the  King  of  France,  explaining  the
serious  difficulties  in  which  Henry's  descent  had  involved
them,  and  lamenting  that  the  present  war  should  have  led
His  Majesty  to  take  measures  hurtful  to  the  interests  of
their  merchants,  upon  whom  the  prosperity  of  Florence
so  largely  depended,  ^^cum  Civitas  yiostra  ex  ■predictis
Florentinis  ex  maiori  parte  consistaL  You  have  always
hitherto  protected  them,"  they  said  in  conclusion,  "and
our  chief  hopes  are  placed,  after  God,  in  your  Majesty,
especially  now  that  Henry  threatens  to  go  to  Pisa  and
march  against  us,  qui  firmavimus  et  parati  sumus  nosfram
quarn  a  vohis  et  a  vestris  recognovimus,  defendere  liber-
tatemy  They  likewise  besought  the  king  to  order
matters  in  such  wise,  that  their  trade  with  France  might
be  pursued  without  interruption,  even  during  the  war.2

Meanwhile     the    emperor     had     despatched     another
embassy  to  Florence,    composed    of  Bishop    Niccolo    of

Botrinto,  and  Pandolfo  Savelli ;  but  when  these  envoys
finally  reached  Lastra,  after  encountering  many  mishaps
by  the  way,  they  were  not  only  robbed,  but  placed  in
mortal  danger.  The  bells  rang  the  alarm  at  their
approach,  armed  men  poured  into  their  lodging,  and
the  Podesta  and  Captain  of  Florence  arrived  barely  in
time  to  save  their  lives.  Accordingly,  by  the  advice  of
those  functionaries,  the  strangers  quitted  the  town  in  the
utmost  haste. ^  Thereupon  (20th  of  November,  131 1)  the
emperor  cited  the  Florentines  to  appear  before  him  in
Genoa  to  tender  apology  and  submission.  Then,  finding
that  —  as  was  to  be  expected  —  they  disregarded  his
summons,  he  placed  their  city  under  the  ban  of  the
Empire.^  Even  this  was  received  with  the  same  indifTer-
ence  as  the  interdicts  of  the  Pope.  But  recalling  their
merchants  from  Genoa,  they  hastened  their  preparations
for  war.

The  magnates  now  gave  another  proof  of  their  irre-
pressible turbulence.  Precisely  at  this  moment,  and
heedless  of  the  grave  danger  menacing  the  Republic,  they
plunged  the  city  in  disorder  with  their  private  feuds.  On
the  nth  of  January,  1312,  Pazzino  de'  Pazzi,  one  of  the
leading  men,  and  much  beloved  by  the  people,  was  set
upon  and  killed,  as  he  rode  to  the  chase,  by  Paffiera  dei
Cavalcanti,  to  avenge  the  loss  of  Masino  de'  Cavalcanti  and
Betto  Brunelleschi,  whose  murder  was  attributed  to  Pazzi.
The  victim's  body  was  carried  to  the  Priors'  Palace,  and
the  indignant  people  rising  to  arms,  marched  under  their
own  banner  to  the  Cavalcanti  houses,  and  burnt  them  to
the  ground.  As  the  speediest  way  of  checking  these
-    tumults,  the  Signory  exiled  the  Cavalcanti  at  once,  con-

ferred  knighthood  on  four  of  the  Pazzi  family,  and
presented  them  with  certain  lands  and  property  in  the
gift  of  the  Commune.i  Thus,  even  at  this  juncture,
order  was  soon  re-established.

IX.

During  this  time  Henry  was  preparing  to  go  to  Rome.
In  the  Imperial  camp  minstrels  were  chanting  the  piteous
tale  of  Conradin's  death,  and  the  popular  muse  of  the
Ghibellines  continued  to  shower  laudatory  greetings  on
the  just  judge,  the  celestial  peacemaker.  Men  of  letters,
poets,  jurisconsults,  and  philosophers  persisted  in  regard-
ing Henry  as  the  new  redeemer  who  was  to  restore  the
Imperial  crown  to  Rome,  give  Italy  freedom  and  peace.
Cino  da  Pistoia  cried,  "Nunc  dimittis  servum  tuum,
Domine,  quia  viderunt  oculi  mei  salutare  tuum.*  But
Dante  Alighieri  was  the  most  exultant  of  all,  for  at  this
moment  he  was  virtually  the  chief  representative  of  the
Imperial  party  in  Italy.  On  Henry's  first  approach  to
the  Alps  he  had  addressed  an  epistle  to  the  princes  and
governments  of  Italy,  exclaiming,  *'  Hosanna  to  thee,
suffering  Italy,  now  wilt  thou  be  envied  of  all,  for
*  Sponsus  tuus  et  mundi  solatium  et  gloria  plebis  tuas,
clementissimus  Henricus,  Divus  et  Augustus  et  Cssar,  ad
nuptias  properat.'  Let  the  oppressed  rejoice,  for  their
redemption  draweth  near.  Let  all  who  have  endured
injuries  like  unto  mine  forgive  and  grant  pardon,  for  now
the  Shepherd  that  cometh  from  God  will  lead  us  all  back
to  the  fold."3

'  Villani,  ix.  33.  The  fact  of  making  the  Pazzi  knights  by  way  of  com-
pensation, serves  to  prove  that  the  title  of  cavaliere  was  already  losing  its
former  significance.  For,  at  the  close  of  the  thirteenth  century,  when
used  as  a  sign  of  nobility,  possession  of  this  title  helped  to  exclude  a  man
from  the  Government.  "  Perrens,  vol.  iii.  p.  145.

D ANTES  EPISTLE  TO  KINGS  AND  POTENTATES.  557

Afterwards,  however,  when  Henry  was  about  to  march
on  Cremona,  and  the  Florentines  had  already  declared
openly  against  him,  Alighieri's  joy  turned  to  wrath,  and
from  the  source  of  the  Arno  in  the  Casentino  hills,  he
wrote  another  epistle,  dated  31st  of  March,  13 11,  and
addressed,  "  Scelestissimis  Florentinis.  Know  ye  not,
God  hath  ordained  that  the  human  race  be  under  the  rule
of  one  emperor,  for  the  defence  of  justice,  peace,  and
civilisation,  inasmuch  as  Italy  was  always  a  prey  to  civil
war  whenever  the  Empire  lapsed  ?  Do  ye  dare,  ye  alone,
to  cast  off  the  yoke  of  freedom  and  seek  for  new  kingdoms,
even  as  though  alia  sit  florentina  civitaSy  alia  sit  romana  ?
Most  foolish  and  insensate  men,  ye  shall  succumb  perforce
to  the  Imperial  eagle.  Know  ye  not  that  true  liberty
consisteth  in  voluntary  obedience  to  Divine  and  human
laws  ?  Yet  while  presuming  to  claim  liberty,  ye  con-
spire against  all  laws!"'

Then,  when  instead  of  marching  forward,  Henry  tarried
in  Lombardy,  to  attack  the  cities  stirred  to  revolt  against
him  by  Florence,  Dante's  indignation  rose  to  its  highest
pitch,  and  on  the  i6th  of  April  of  the  same  year  he
addressed  another  epistle  to  the  emperor,  saying,  "  Men
declare  that  thou  dost  waver  in  thy  purpose,  and  wouldst
turn  back  from  it,  disheartened.  Art  not,  then,  the
man  expected  by  us  all  ?  When  my  hands  touched  thy
feet,  I  exultantly  cried,  '  Ecce  Agnus  Dei,  ecce  qui
abstulit  peccata  mundi.'  Why  tarriest  thou  ?  If  thine
own  glory  move  thee  not,  let  thy  son's,  at  least,  stir  thee.

until  thou  hast  extirpated  the  root  of  the  evil.  Art
ignorant  mayhap  where  the  rank  fox  lurketh  in  hiding  ?
1"he  beast  drinketh  from  the  Arno,  polluting  the  waters
with  its  jaws,  Knowest  thou  not  that  Florence  is  its
name  ?  Florence  is  the  viper  that  stings  its  mother's
breast,  the  black  sheep  that  corrupts  the  whole  flock,  the
Myrrha  guilty  of  incest  v/ith  her  father.  In  fact  it  is
Florence  who  rends  the  bosom  of  the  mother  -  Rome,
that  created  her  in  the  likeness  of  herself,  and  violates  the
commands  of  the  Father  of  the  Faithful,  who  is  agreed  with
thee.  And  Florence,  while  contemning  her  own  sovereign,
sides  with  an  alien  monarch  and  others'  rights.  Delay
no  more,  but  haste  to  slay  the  nt^  Goliath  with  the  sling
of  thy  wisdom  and  the  stone  of  thy  might."  '

This  semi-scholastic,  semi-Biblico-classical,  and  often
inflated  language,  admirably  represents  the  ideas  of  the
period,  and  proves  the  excited  state  of  Dante's  mind.  He
was  undoubtedly  the  first  to  put  clearly  into  words  the
new  Ghibelline  theory  that  had  been  gradually  developing
and  maturing  in  his  mind  ever  since  he  had  indignantly
parted  from  his  fellow-exiles,  and  turned  to  solitary
study.  Although,  as  we  have  already  remarked,  this  new
conception — more  amply  developed  in  Dante's  "  Mon-
archia " — was  certainly  theoretical  and  literary  rather
than  practical,  it  was  deeply  rooted  nevertheless  in  the
thought  of  the  period,  and  the  work  devoted  to  its  dis-
closure already  shows,  by  unmistakable  signs,  that  the
spirit  of  the  age  was  about  to  be  transformed.  \n  reading
the  "Monarchia"  we  are  often  plunged  back  in  the
Middle  Ages,  but  the  pale  gleaming  of  a  new  dawn  often
shimmers  before  our  eyes.  "  The  Empire  represents  the
law  upon  which  human  society  is  firmly  based  ;  it  is
derived  accordingly  from  God,  the  source  of  the  Imperial,
as   of    the    Papal    power."     In    this    we    may    already

'  Epiitle  viL


DA  WN  OF  A  XE  W  POLITICAL  IVEA.  559

discern  the  conception  oi  an  independent  secular  society
emancipated  from  the  Church,  and  thus  the  idea  of  a  State
founded  upon  law — an  idea  inspired  by  ancient  Rome,  and
suggested  by  new  practical  needs — is  first  put  into  words
at  the  close  of  the  Middle  Ao-es  v.-hich  had  denied  its
possibility.  But  e\en  Dante  failed  to  see  that  the  new
State  must  be  intrinsically  national,  neither  could  he
perceive  that  the  universd  Empire  he  invoked,  and  now
represented  by  Henry  VI I, ,  was  precisely  what  made  it
impossible  for  that  State  to  be  formed.  Thus  the  novel
and  almost  prophetic  portion  ot  his  book  is  neutralised
bv  its  theoretic  and  scholastic  elements.  The  independent
secular  State,  foreseen  by  his  lofty  intellect,  was  indeed
bound  to  triumph  ;  but  its  victory  implied  the  destruction
of  the  medieval  Empire  of  which  his  book  was  intended
to  be  the  apotheosis.  On  the  contrary,  the  "  Monarchia  "
became  its  epitaph,  as  some  one  has  justly  remarked.
Nevertheless,  some  vaguelv  distant  conception  of  the
State,  and  even  of  the  national  State,  occasionally  flashes
forth  in  Dante's  book,  though  still  battling  with  the  mists
of  revived  classic  lore.  The  Empire  is  not,  in  fact,  to  be
separated  from  the  Eternal  City  that  gave  it  birth,  and  of
which  it  is  the  heir.  Rome,  the  natural  and  permanent
seat  of  empire,  was  to  be  restored  to  her  ancient  grandeur
by  the  coming  of  the  emperor.  Also,  were  not  Rome
and  Italy  one  and  the  same  thing  ?  Henry  VII.  was  the
representative,  not  only  of  law  but  of  peace,  freedom,  and
civilisation,  therefore  by  him  Italy's  woes  would  be
brouijht  to  an  end,  and  Italv's  freedom  gu;iranteed.  Was
not  Henry  the  master  of  the  world :  Hence  he  could
desire  nothing  more,  and  could  not  fail  to  be  the  just  lord
and  father  of  all,  respecting  every  legally  acquired  right
and  jurisdiction.  But  it  was  precisely  the  emperor's
yearning  to  be  lord  of  all  men  and  all  things  that  was
so  opposed  to  the  national  spirit  that  was  already  begin-


56o       FLORENTINE  EXILES  AND  HENRY  VIL

ning  to  stir  many  minds,  and  that — if  almost  unawares
— Alighieri  was  so  earnestly  lauding,  while  practialiy
denying  it  by  imploring  the  resurrection  of  the  Empire.

This  contradiction  gave  a  truly  tragic  hue  to  Dante's
mental  state  at  the  time.  He  was  profoundly  sincere,
profoundly  persuaded  of  the  truth  of  his  ideas.  In-
flamed with  holy  wrath  against  all  supporters  of  the
Pope  and  the  Angevins,  mindful  of  the  deeds  he  had
seen  committed  in  Florence  by  Boniface  VIII.  and  Charles
of  Valois,  he  had  a  premonition,  amounting  almost  to
second  sight,  of  the  numerous  calamities  to  be  wrought
upon  all  Italy  by  the  obstinacy  of  his  opponents.  But  he
failed  to  see  that  his  own  political  theory  would  have
thrust  Italy  back  into  the  feudal  Middle  Ages,  neutralising
the  work  of  the  communes  and  the  result  of  the  prolonged
struggles,  in  which  he  himself  had  been  recently  in-
volved. The  conflicting  emotions  stirring  within  him
found  vent  in  the  "  Divine  Comedy "  depicting  two
different  and  often  contrasting  worlds,  and  wherem  the
past  is  touched  and  transformed  by  a  new  spirit,  made
the  source  of  a  new  future,  new  art,  new  literature  and
new  civilisation.  In  this  great  poem  the  reality  of  human
passion  and  human  life  breaks  through  the  mystic  clouds
of  the  Middle  Ages,  and  finally  disperses  them  for  ever.
Therefore  philosophers  and  historians  may  find  in  the  poem
all  the  constituents  of  an  age  in  which  one  form  of  society
was  dying  out,  and  another  springing,  almost  visibly,  to
life.  But  although  the  conflict  of  thought  in  Dante's
mind  might  produce  immortal  verse,  it  could  not  possibly
create  any  efficient  political  system.

On  the  latter  point  the  advantage  lay  with  the  Floren-
tines, inasmuch  as  they  always  clung  to  actualities  and  the
needs  of  the  moment.  They  weighed  and  counted  their
bales  of  silks  and  woollens,  and  calculated  the  probable
damage  to  their  import  and  export  trade  from  the  triumph


TRAGIC  CONFLICT  OF  DANTE'S  IDEAS.       561

|{  of  the  Empire  in  Italy.  They  saw  that  it  would  inevitably
ruin  their  commerce  ;  and  by  assuring  victory  to  their
foes,  i.e.^  to  the  magnates,  Pisans,  and  many  petty  Italian
tyrants,  would  overthrow  their  own  freedom  and  the
government  of  the  guilds.  Was  not  this  belief  justified
by  the  fate  of  Milan,  Cremona,  and  Brescia.''  This  was
why  the  Florentines  called  the  Guelph  cities  to  their  side,
and  in  the  name  of  Italy,  freedom,  and  their  common
independence,  united  them  all  in  a  defensive  alliance
against  the  foreign  foe.  Nevertheless  they  had  also
leagued  with  King  Robert  and  espoused  the  cause  of
France  and  the  Pope,  whose  triumph  was  destined  to
prove  fatal  to  Italian  liberty  and  independence.  As  we
have  previously  shown,  the  nation  could  only  be  built  up
on  the  ruins  and  by  the  destruction  of  both  parties.  The
long  and  difficult  course  of  historic  evolution  requisite  to
prepare  the  way  for  a  distant  future  was  then  unknown
to  all.  The  Florentines  only  thought  of  securing  present
safety,  and  in  this  they  were  well  advised  and  fortunate.


X.

Meanwhile  that  '*  crowned  victim  of  his  own  fate,"  as
Del  Lungo  calls  Henry  VII.,  continued  his  advance  with
untroubled  self-confidence.  The  royal  peacemaker  felt
no  remorse  at  having  drenched  Italian  cities  in  blood  and
disseminated  discord.  Not  even  the  loss  of  wife  and
brother,  the  slaughter  of  his  best  soldiers,  the  desertion  of
numerous  adherents,  nor  the  scathing  contempt  of  his
foes  availed  to  shake  his  self-assurance  and  certainty  of
success.  Calm  and  composed  as  ever,  he  entered  Pisa  on
the  6th  of  March,  13 12,  was  welcomed  with  great  pomp,
and  remained  amid  this  truly  friendly  population  until
the  23rd  of  April.     While  at  Lausanne  he  had  already

37


562       FLORENTINE  EXILES  AND  HENR  Y  VII.

received  sixty  thousand  florins  from  the  Pisans,  and  they
now  showed  the  sincerity  of"  their  submission  to  him  by
accepting  new  magistrates  at  his  hands  and  promising  a
second  gift  of  money  equal  to  the  first.  ^  Neither  did  he
feel  the  slightest  alarm  on  hearing  that  the  army  of
Robert's  brother,  Prince  John,  had  gained  reinforcements
in  Rome.

That  prince  had  brought  with  him  a  force  of  over  six
hundred  Catalan  and  Apulian  horse,  and  had  now  been
joined  by  two  hundred  of  the  best  Florentine  cavalry,  led
by  De  la  Rat,  who,  in  addition  to  his  Catalan  troops,  had
also  collected  one  thousand  foot.  Fresh  contingents  had
poured  in  from  Lucca,  Sienna,  and  other  towns.  The
Capitol,  the  Castle  of  St.  Angelo,  and  Trastevere,  and  all
the  fortresses  were  therefore  held  by  the  prince.  And  as
a  final  stroke,  the  Neapolitan  king,  after  first  stating  that
he  occupied  Rome  for  the  Empire,  now  declared  openly
against  Henry.  Nevertheless  the  latter  continued  his
march  with  only  one  thousand  horse  and  a  body  of
infantry,  and  on  the  7th  of  May,  13 12,  entered  the
Eternal  City.  He  quickly  attacked  and  won  the  Capitol ;
but  in  seeking  to  force  his  way  to  St.  Peter's  to  grasp
the  Imperial  crown,  a  real  battle  took  place  in  the
streets  ;  and  a  sortie  from  Castle  St.  Angelo  repulsed
him  with  heavy  loss.  Nor  would  his  coronation  have
been  accomplished  at  all,  had  not  the  Roman  people
declared  in  his  favour  and  by  threats  of  violence  compelled
the  prelates  to  disregard  custom  and  perform  the  solemn
rite  in  the  Lateran  Church  on  the  29th  of  June.  But
Henry  was  now  obliged  to  recognise  that  even  the  Pope
was  adverse,  when  the  latter  commanded  him  to  refrain
from  attacking  Naples,  to  make  a  twelvemonth's  truce
with  the  king,  to  leave  Rome  on  the  day  of  his  coronation,

to  renounce  all  rights  over  the  Eternal  City,  and  never
re-enter  it  without  permission.  At  last  the  Pope  had
dropped  his  mask,  and  the  Florentines  were  proved  good
prophets.  But  at  the  very  moment  in  which  their  Guelph
policy  triumphed,  and  the  breach  between  Pope  and
emperor  was  so  plainly  revealed,  the  people  proclaimed
Rome  an  Imperial  city  and  their  Capitol  the  permanent
seat  of  the  emperor,  whose  authority  was  to  be  acknow-
ledged as  emanating  from  the  Roman  people  alone.
"  Dum  sola  tribunitia,  exterminatis  Patribus,  potestas
adolevisset  illo  sub  magistratu  .  .  .  omnia  hasc  parari
Cssari,  ipsum  evocandum  in  Urbem,  vehendumque
triumphaliter  in  Capitolium,  principatum  ab  sola  plebe
recogniturum."  ^

Dante's  own  idea  was  now  uttered  by  the  voice  of
Rome.

At  last,  and  after  much  hesitation,  Henry  decided  to
adopt  the  advice  proffered  by  the  great  poet  some  time
before,  and  went  to  lay  siege  to  Florence.  Crossing  the
Roman  Campagna  in  August,  his  army  was  decimated  by
fever,  and  after  the  capture  of  Montevarchi  and  San
Giovanni,  he  halted  at  Figline.2  The  Florentines,  without
good  commanders  and  with  most  disorderly  haste,  marched
a  large  force  of  infantry  and  1,800  horse  to  the  Castle  of
Incisa.  But  they  then  declined  to  accept  battle,  and  the
emperor  continued  his  journey  by  another  route,  vigor-
ously repulsing  every  sortie  made  from  Incisa  for  the
purpose  of  arresting  his  passage.  On  the  19th  of
September  he  invested  Florence  on  all  sides,  establishing
his  headquarters  at  San  Salvi.  The  citizens,  having
received  no  news  from  the  army,  were  almost  taken  by
surprise,  but,  snatching  their  weapons,  hurried  to  the
walls  under  the  banners  of  the  people,  and  accompanied

by  their  bishop,  sword  in  hand,  together  with  all  his
clergy.  Two  days  later  the  troops  sent  to  take  the  field
against  the  emperor  made  their  way  back  to  Florence
across  country ;  reinforcements  arrived  from  Lucca,
Sienna,  Pistoia,  Bologna,  Romagna,  and  in  short  from
all  the  cities  of  the  League.  Thus,  Villani  tells  us,  an
army  was  collected  of  4,000  horse  and  innumerable
infantry.  The  emperor  having  only  a  force  of  800
German  knights,  1,000  Italian  horse,  and  a  considerable
body  of  foot,  was  merely  able  to  ravage  the  land.  Fortu-
nately for  him,  the  year's  harvest  had  been  so  abundant
that  there  was  no  difficulty  in  provisioning  his  troops.
Even  now,  in  spite  of  their  great  numerical  superiority,
the  Florentines  still  shrank  from  attempting  a  pitched
battle  ;  but  inside  the  town  they  felt  so  completely  secure
that  they  only  closed  the  gates  facing  the  emperor's  camp,
leaving  the  others  open  to  traffic  as  in  times  of  peace.
This  state  of  things  lasted  to  the  month  of  November,
but  then  Henry's  patience  being  altogether  exhausted,
he  raised  the  siege  and  set  out  for  Poggibonsi  and  Pisa.
The  Florentines  started  in  pursuit,  and  attacked  him
several  times  on  the  road,  with  varying  results.  The
emperor  tarried  at  Poggibonsi  to  the  6th  of  March,  13 13,
without  provisions,  or  funds,  and  his  army  was  so  reduced
that  his  cavalry  had  dwindled  to  1,000  horse.  Never-
theless he  continued  his  march,  and  although,  according  to
Villani,  his  assailants  were  four  to  one,  he  contrived  to
fight  his  way  to  Pisa,  and  arrived  there  on  the  9th  of
March.

At  this  time,  although  his  health  was  ruined  by  mental
worry  and  bodily  hardship,  his  purse  emptied,  and  his
army  melted  away,  the  emperor  was  still  calm  and  hopeful.
In  Pisa  he  made  many  attempts  to  pursue  the  war  by
legal  devices  :  depriving  the  Florentines  of  their  judicial
rights,    dismissing  their  judges    and    notaries,    imposing


ABORTIVE  SIEGE  OF  FLORENCE.  565

heavy  fines,  and  condemning  many  of  their  citizens  to
confiscation  and  punishment.  And  regardless  of  the  fact
that  these  sentences  had  no  effect,  he  continued  to  launch
them  as  before.  He  prohibited  the  Florentines  from
coining  money,  while  permitting  Ubizzo  Spinola  of  Genoa
and  the  Marquis  of  Monferrato  to  fabricate  within  their
own  territories  false  florins  marked  with  the  Florentine
stamp.  Naturally  an  act  so  damaging  to  the  public  credit
provoked  severe  blame. ^  He  condemned  King  Robert  as
a  traitor  to  the  Empire,  and  made  alliance  with  Frederic
of  Sicily  and  the  Genoese.  He  also  determined  to  march
against  Naples,  although  the  Pope  had  threatened  excom-
munication on  any  one  attacking  that  kingdom,  which
was  considered  a  fief  of  the  Church.  Burning  with  zeal
for  this  new  enterprise,  he  demanded  money  and  men
from  Lombardy  and  Germany.  He  was  thus  enabled  to
collect  2,500  foreign  and  1,500  Italian  horse,  besides  an
army  of  foot  soldiers.  Seventy  galleys  were  equipped  by
the  Genoese  ;  fifty  by  King  Frederic.  The  Pisans,  who
had  already  sacrificed  everything  to  his  cause,  managed
to  furnish  twenty  galleys.  He  also  obtained  a  certain
amount  of  money,  and  set  off  on  the  8th  of  August,
13 1 3,  with  some  reasonable  hope  of  success.  But  his
sudden  death  at  Buonconvento,  on  the  24th  of  May,
brought  everything  to  an  end.

On  the  27th  of  the  same  month  the  Florentines
exultantly  announced  to  their  allies  that  "  Jesus  Christ
had  procured  the  death  of  that  most  haughty  tyrant,
Henry,  entitled  King  of  the  Romans  and  Emperor,  by
the  rebel  persecutors  of  Holy  Church,  to  wit,  your
Ghibellines  and  our  foes."  2  During  Henry's  life  they
had  conferred  the  lordship  of  Florence  on  Robert  for
five  years,  and  now  stretched  the  term  to  three  more,  on
the  well-understood  condition  that  their  free,  Guelph,
'  Villani,  ix.  49.  '  Bonaini,  of.  cit.,  ii.,  ccclxv.


566        FLORENTINE  EXILES  AND  HENRY  VII

and  popular  government  should  be  left  intact.  All  they
asked  from  him  was  a  military  leader  bearing  the  king's
flag,  acting  in  his  name,  contributing  a  few  sturdy  men  at
arms,  and  competent  to  take  command  of  the  citizen
army  in  order  to  protect  the  Republic  from  possible
attacks  on  the  part  of  Pisa  or  Genoa,  and  against
Ghibelline  captains  such  as  Uguccione  della  Fagguiola
and  others.  Pisa  and  Uguccione  were  their  most
dreaded  foes.  The  latter,  indeed,  had  already  hired  one
thousand  of  Henry's  soldiers,  composing  the  first  of  those
Free  Companies  destined  to  speedily  become  the  real
scourge  of  Italy. '

The  Pope,  now  reduced  to  be  the  slave  of  France,
threw  himself  into  the  arms  of  King  Robert,  and  named
him  Senator  of  Rome,  thus  causing  the  return  thither
of  Angevin  vicars.  As  the  Pontiff  hoped  to  be  able  to
assume  the  authority  of  the  Empire  during  the  inter-
regnum, he  annulled  Henry's  decree  against  Robert,  and
appointed  him  Imperial  Vicar  in  Italy  for  a  term
extending  to  two  months  after  the  election  of  the  next
emperor.

Notwithstanding  Robert's  augmented  power  and  his
lordship  over  their  city,  the  Florentines  were  now  vastly
improved  in  strength,  both  morally  and  materially,  since
they  had  foreseen  future  events  far  more  accurately  than
others,  had  been  the  chief  authors  of  all  that  had  occurred,
and  were  the  friends  and  allies  of  those  who  had  triumphed
with  them.  The  people  were  substantially  supreme  ;  the
magnates  were  overthrown  ;  and  trade  which  had  gone
on  uninterruptedly  during  the  war,  attained  more  vigorous
development  now  that  peace  was  restored.  But  what
had  become  of  the  Guelph  Federation,  and  of  the  name  of
Italy  invoked  to  call  it  into  being  .?  All  had  vanished  in
a  flash.     The  very  fact  of  the   Florentines  now  feeling

'  Grcgorovius,  vi.  89.


A  UGMENTED  PROSPERIJ  Y  OF  FLORENCE.    567

compelled  to  crave  protection  from  a  king,  clearly  proves
that  their  vast  prosperity,  notwithstanding  the  Republic,
had  neither  sufficient  self-reliance  nor  strength  to  pre-
serve its  independence  unaided.  This  state  of  things
necessarily  involved  new  complications  and  new  dangers
which  could  be  in  no  case  long  averted.  The  Italian
Commune  was  doomed  to  decay ;  the  modern  State
destined  to  be  born  ;  but  the  moment  of  its  birth  lay
beyond  a  period  of  oppression.  The  same  fate  was
already  distantly  impending  over  Florence.

After  Henry  VII.  was  dead,  both  the  nature  of  the
Empire  and  its  relations  with  Italy  were  changed.  So,
too,  the  Pope's  alliance  with  France  radically  transformed
the  attitude  of  the  Papal  power  towards  the  Italian  com-
munes, for  it  became  increasingly  hostile  to  their  freedom
and  independence.  The  Middle  Ages  had  come  to  an
end,  and  an  entirely  new  epoch  was  now  opening  in  the
history  of  Florence  and  of  Italy  in  general.
